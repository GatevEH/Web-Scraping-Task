Airlines balk at county leases’ better service clause,['https://cdn.aspentimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/04/bizcover-atd-102119-1-1024x684.jpg'],"Commercial airlines are poised to lock into separate three-year leases with Aspen-Pitkin County Airport but without one clause in their agreements suggesting they speed up their service. The lease agreements for American, Delta and United will go before the Pitkin County Board of Commissioners for final approval Wednesday, but absent from their contractual language is one line the airlines rejected: “Airline shall endeavor to provide sufficient personnel and staffing levels so as to not cause undue flight delays/cancellations.”“It wasn’t a mandate,” airport director Dan Bartholomew said Monday. “It was more written as ‘please’ do something. … We knew it was a bit of a reach to get them to sign something very prescriptive. This was an attempt to at least try.”In a memo to the BOCC in advance of this week’s vote on the three leases, Bartholomew wrote the airport will “continue to actively work with its airline partners to strive for operational efficiencies and enhanced customer experiences.”American, Delta and United all served Aspen last ski season — Delta is taking this summer off — and were plagued by travel delays. Roughly one-third, or 32.4%, of incoming commercial flights to Aspen were delayed from January through April, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. During that period, 54.8% of the flights arrived on time. The remaining flights —  12.8% — were cancelled. All told, the first four months saw 1,612 commercial flights arrive on time, 953 run late and 260 cancelled, according to the BTS.“This past winter was especially bad,” said Basalt-based air travel consultant Bill Tomcich, noting large amounts of snowfall and a staff shortage at SkyWest, the feeder airline for American and United, as the primary culprits for the delays. The summer, however, is trending differently, Tomcich said Monday.“At least with the month of June and the first 11 days of July, the reliability with a thick schedule has been excellent,” he said. “Both American and United are close to 98% completion rates. That’s really good, but it’s not perfect.”On-time arrival data was available through April from the BTS.Travelers also have experienced delays after touching down in Aspen, said Bartholomew, noting that there was a backup of planes because of the high traffic volumes on the ground at the airport, meaning passengers could not disembark. “We’ve had some complaints where aircraft will arrive and get stuck on the apron for a period of time,” he said, adding the ground delays are because there has not been enough airline staff to marshal and park aircraft.  The county, which operates the airport, has been leasing to the airlines on a month-to-month basis but is seeking the three-year leases, which include a two-year option. Bartholomew’s memo to the BOCC said the lease agreements “can be advantageous when seeking investments from bondholders, and their rating agencies” as plans for the airport’s potential redevelopment of its passenger terminal and infrastructure. “While Airports can legally operate without formal lease agreements, such agreements offer the sponsor greater assurances of both financial sustainability and space/asset management. Such an agreement offers longer term financial stability, better asset stewardship, and opportunities for ongoing and future facility capital investment,” the memo said. If approved, the leases will take effect in Oct. 1. Lease payments in 2022 include $98.13 per square foot for use of interior terminal passenger facilities during the down seasons and $137.39 per square foot during the high season. Exterior rates are $32.71 during the offseason and $45.79 during the busy season, according to county documents.Other fees are attached to airlines’ use of share spaces, along with landing fees that are computed at a rate ranging from $8.24 to $11.53 per thousand pounds of maximum allowable, gross-landing weight of an aircraft.

Aspen officials hire PR firm for entrance public education effort,['https://cdn.aspentimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/08/nonresidents-atd-083120-1-1024x466.jpg'],"Aspen City Council on Tuesday approved a contract for nearly $89,000 that is part of a public education campaign about the past, present and future of the Entrance to Aspen.The contract with Darnauer-Manifest Communications includes $58,950 for the base scope of work and $29,539 for additional services for radio and social media support.Recognizing that there has not been public dialogue around the Entrance to Aspen for almost two decades, council last year agreed to earmark $150,000 for a community education campaign about the record of decision rendered in 1998 by the Colorado Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration.After years of analysis, public debate and policy work, the record of decision’s preferred alternative identifies the Entrance to Aspen as a two-lane parkway that goes under the Marolt-Thomas Open Space via a cut-and-cover tunnel that has a transit component including a light rail system and ends up on Seventh and Main streets leading to Rubey Park.The  is to create a shared understanding in the community of what the Entrance to Aspen project is, which elements of it have already been implemented and what the challenges are ahead, according to City Engineer Trish Aragon and Assistant City Manager Diane Foster.While the preferred alternative has laid dormant due to negating public votes and conflicting political wills, the record of decision was revisited in 2007, but there was no consensus in the community to carry it forward.Councilwoman Rachel Richards said that she, like many residents, has been concerned about growing traffic congestion, especially in the West End neighborhood which is used as an alternative to Main Street in the afternoon rush hour.“I greatly appreciate council’s support of $150,000 to basically bring the record of decision on the entrance to Highway 82 up to modern standards,” she said. “We will have the information digitized and online and be able to reintroduce this to the so many people who are new to our community.”The public education effort will include an Entrance to Aspen website and document library, a print campaign, a community survey and polling, open houses and videos appearing on GrassRoots TV.There are three components to the project, including technical analysis, video production services and community education.The technical analysis is estimated to cost $24,957. The city has a contract with HNTP Corp. for this portion of the work, which is to obtain clarity around the current state of the record of decision, engage with CDOT, and do a risk analysis of opening the record of decision and potential funding of a future solution.Within the existing budget, $29,280 is being utilized to develop two videos. One will be a long-form informative video that is approximately four to six minutes in length and describes the project in depth.A second short-form version is envisioned to be no longer than 90 seconds and is a concise summary of the project, which will be formatted for social media use.The videos are intended to educate and inform Aspen residents and the public about the proposed improvements to the Entrance to Aspen, the record of decision and project development.The third component, which is the $88,489 contract with Darnauer-Manifest Communications, includes updating the website and document library, a print and social media education campaign, open houses, media support and polling at the end of the public education process.City officials are interested in resurrecting the Entrance to Aspen conversation not only to educate new residents and refamiliarize longtime Aspenites, but also to address traffic coming in and out of town and replacing an aging Castle Creek Bridge.The 60-year-old bridge also acts as the emergency egress that is critical for both mass evacuation and first responders’ access to the hospital.Richards said now is the time to act on federal infrastructure money becoming available for local governments and agencies.“I think if we miss this window, we will be living with an old bridge that has maybe 20 years of useful life and be struggling to figure out how to manage it if it gets weight restricted or if it fails before we have a new bridge in place,” she said.",13.07.2022,Carolyn Sackariason,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/aspen-officials-hire-pr-firm-for-entrance-public-education-effort/
Latest round of Snowmass Village community survey in the works,['https://cdn.aspentimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/07/townhall-svs-1024x683.jpeg'],"This year’s version of the Snowmass Village community survey, for the most part, will look a lot like the previous ones, according to Assistant Town Manager Greg LeBlanc.The proposed questions for the 2022 survey are “more or less” the same as the questions from the 2019 survey, and the town intends to use the same firm that conducted the last two iterations in 2017 and 2019, LeBlanc said during a July 11 Town Council work session. The overall goal is to collect similar data each time the survey goes out so the town can look at trends over the course of multiple surveys, LeBlanc said. The town usually conducts the survey every couple of years to take the pulse on community sentiments about town services and priorities. The newest iteration is slated to go out later this year.“It’ll be interesting to see what we get back as it always is, but I think we’re a pretty good place to send that out with the comments that have been suggested,” Mayor Bill Madsen said at the meeting. A side-by-side comparison of the 2019 and 2022 surveys shows that people who participated last time will see some changes, including several new questions. The draft 2022 survey has added a question about the short-term rental of single-family homes, and whether it’s “good for the community,” “just right” or “not good for the community.” Councilman Tom Fridstein asked for a bit more clarity on what aspect of the rentals — having them, allowing them or the amount of them, for instance — is subject to input, so the wording of the question might be workshopped a bit. The question in the community survey is separate from the current open feedback form for people to provide input on a short-term rental permit system and possible regulations.Another addition asks about the preservation of some town characteristics: “If you could keep one thing the same in Snowmass Village forever, what would it be?”There also are new questions about satisfaction with town recreation programs and about what factors prevent people from using the Village Shuttle. Unlike the 2019 iteration, this year’s draft survey doesn’t include a question about the current amount of public art on display in the town.Before LeBlanc sent the survey draft to council, he gathered feedback from department directors that helped inform the way the survey is set up this year, LeBlanc said. Some questions were “refined to reflect the current environment,” and questions were ordered to “keep like items together” in categories set up by department, he said. The 2022 survey has about four dozen questions, which is on par with 2019; there were a little more than three dozen questions in 2017. Amid an inundation of surveys everywhere, though, Councilman Tom Goode suggested erring on the side of brevity to encourage more participation. “I don’t think we’re going to get everybody back, because people don’t want to take the time to do a survey. … Everywhere you go, whether it’s a restaurant, or hotel, everybody wants a survey: ‘How did we do for you?” Goode said.Survey-takers will get the chance to opt out of questions if they don’t want to answer them, LeBlanc said. They’ll also have the chance to provide open-ended feedback at the end of most sections.",13.07.2022,Kaya Williams,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/latest-round-of-snowmass-village-community-survey-in-the-works/
Town Park by the numbers: plans show how rodeo layout will change,['https://cdn.aspentimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/06/EDLrodeo-atd-062322-1-1024x819.jpg'],"The Snowmass Rodeo grounds will indeed be getting bigger with the proposed revamp of Town Park in Snowmass Village, pending review and approval from the town’s Planning Commission and Town Council. But side-by-side plans for the current and revamped layouts show that through the overall grounds — not counting parking — are growing, the way the space is distributed on the grounds is changing. That would yield a smaller arena for competition and more space for spectators. Contestant parking is also shrinking substantially. Connect One Design’s Sara Tie showed the  to town officials as part of a presentation for the Planning Commission on June 29 and also included the materials in a packet for a presentation to the Town Council on July 5 during an owner’s review of the Town Park redesign project. The Planning Commission will enter its third consecutive meeting of special review for the Town Park project Wednesday night, where commissioners will continue to evaluate whether the plans meet specific land use criteria. The Town Council is tentatively scheduled to conduct a regulatory public hearing on that front on July 18, according to a ; the town is also the owner of the project and has been reviewing overall design in owner’s review discussions.The footprint for the rodeo arena, the spectator areas and the pens, chutes and operations areas is 82,181 feet. The proposed footprint for those same areas is 85,118 square feet, according to the plans. The space will be redistributed a bit among the arena, spectator and operations zones, though. The arena for competition will be narrower and longer, with a smaller footprint overall. It currently covers 30,642 square feet and will shrink to 29,143 square feet with the new design. It’s currently about 226 feet, 7 inches long and about 136 feet, 10 inches wide at its longest and widest points, with a somewhat lopsided rectangle shape with rounded corners.The plans for the future rodeo shows a layout that’s 235 feet, 5 inches long and 130 feet wide at the longest and widest points, with an evened-out shape that looks like a rectangle with the corners cut off. The pens, chutes and operations areas will be getting slightly bigger. The current footprint is 24,026 square feet; the proposed footprint is 24,732 square feet.The spectator areas, which would consolidate all seating to one side of the rodeo, gain the lion’s share of the square footage. The current footprint is 27,513 square feet; that would grow to 31,243 square feet with the Town Park revamp. But the footprint for contestant parking is going to get a lot smaller, with the square footage shrinking by about 38%. Currently, there are 68,773 square feet of space where contestants can park their trucks and trailers and unload animals and competitors for the rodeo. That’s enough to fit 37 trucks and trailers on the dirt lot next to the arena, plus five more at the “Checkpoint Charlie” pullout off of Brush Creek Road, according to the plans. The proposed plans show 42,327 square feet of contestant parking, enough to fit 32 trucks and trailers in a reoriented paved parking lot, plus five more at Checkpoint Charlie, according to the plans. That’s a 13.5% decrease in the number of trucks that can park in the main lot. Andy Worline, the town’s parks, recreation and trails director, said in an interview the discrepancy between that number and the 38% decrease in square footage is based on parking the trucks and trailers in a more “efficient” way. The truck and trailer calculation is based on assumptions that the trucks are 20 feet long, pulling 27-foot-long gooseneck trailers, and that the rigs are at least 15 feet apart side-to-side and 14 feet apart bumper-to-bumper. (A  from the Roaring Fork Horse Council, a nonprofit committed to equestrian issues in the valley, recommends that there “must be” 18 feet between trucks and trailers side by side to create adequate space for horses.)Worline said there’s a “possibility” that there could be more parking at Checkpoint Charlie, but that’s not a guarantee. The horse council has also expressed concerns about the impact of the hard paved surface on the animals who compete in the rodeo. There is no designated soft-surface warm-up area in the current rodeo layout, nor is there one included in the future rodeo plans. The “flex lawn” area north of the rodeo is smaller, for one thing. Previous plans showed a lawn big enough to fit two soccer fields that could each accommodate U11 youth soccer teams; it would have covered about 57,000 square feet, Worline said. The lawn could be used for other sports, too; the U11 fields are just a point of reference for size. With the updated plans, the proposed lawn will eventually be about 47,000 square feet, which could still fit one U11 soccer field or several other recreation spaces, Worline said in the interview. It won’t reach that full size until some playground equipment is removed, though. The playground removal — plus some tree removal, revision of a path and full regrading of the field to the edge of the wetlands — isn’t part of the scope of phase one of the project right now. And eventually, a playground would pop up again, just on the other side of the park, Worline and Tie said at the July 5 council meeting. The field would still “roughly double” the size of the existing lawn there, according to Tie, and it could still be set up as two smaller sports fields side by side, Worline said.That adjustment allows the rodeo grounds to shift about 10 feet further north than previously planned, according to Tie and Worline. The distance from the south end to the north end of the grounds won’t be getting bigger, though: “It’s almost like you took the puzzle piece and moved it up,” Worline said in an interview.The updated plans do show more space for attendee circulation on one side of the arena, with  17 feet, 10 inches between the grandstands (planned to be all on one side of the grounds) and the arena fence. The current rodeo, which has stands on both sides of the arena, varies in circulation space: A map shows that it’s 8 feet, 2 inches between the bleachers and the fence at the narrowest spot and 14 feet at the widest spot, depending on where people are walking. ",13.07.2022,Kaya Williams,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/town-park-by-the-numbers/
Willoughby: Goose gossip,['https://cdn.aspentimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/07/willoughby-atd-071022.jpeg'],"My father spent many days and nights in Queens Gulch at the Midnight Mine camp. He enjoyed its location, especially the abundance of wildlife. He passed on this memory.It was late in October 1933. There had been a couple of light snowstorms that fall but the snow had melted. Father was outside, while most of the employees were either in the tunnel or working inside in the mill. Sensitive to even small changes in weather at that altitude, 9,500 feet, he could sense a major change in the air. The camp did not have a barometer, but he concluded, from experience, it was a change to lower air pressure.Around 4 in the afternoon there was a loud noise overhead. A sizable flock of wild geese were flying fast and honking like they were excited about something. They were flying in formation heading east. Queens Gulch is narrow, so the view of them was short as they flew out of sight quickly. Father concluded a storm might be coming as most storms came from the southwest and the geese were flying away from its path.Others who were outside and witnessed the geese chimed in agreeing that a storm was coming, and the storm grew larger to the point where they speculated on the camp being buried in snow.The goose gossip went on and on until the evening meal. Good grub silenced the discussion for a while as they couldn’t swallow and talk goose at the same time. After dinner, Father phoned town to check barometer readings and was told it was reaching very low local levels. Father bunked with a Swedish miner named Carl in one of the camp’s cabins. Carl recalled that in the “old country” when geese honked like that, Swedes would stoke their fires with 10 times the usual firewood.Father did not sleep well that night thinking about the goose omen. He remembered the winter of 1932 when the camp gulch was attacked by snowslides so bad that it closed the camp road for two weeks. Poles and telephone lines were also destroyed, a costly expense to repair in those Depression days. He fell asleep dreaming of deep deep snow.He awoke the next morning to a colder day than the previous day, but the sky was clear. There had, however, been a snowstorm, but only 3 inches lay on the ground. There was no goose convention at the breakfast table.Not only was there little snow that night, but little for the whole winter. There was so little the teamsters that hauled food and materials to the camp and ore out had difficulty with their sleds. In late March there was about 2 feet of snow measured in the camp. A normal winter would show about 6 feet or more. There was even less in town. Kobey’s clothing store was stuck at the end of the year with an overstock of overshoes.We have NOAA and the National Weather Service to inform us today, but wouldn’t it be more fun to pay attention to goose omens?",10.07.2022,,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/willoughby-goose-gossip/
City of Aspen’s plans for new employee housing shelved since pandemic began,['https://cdn.aspentimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/06/download.png'],"The city of Aspen’s plan to build nearly 50 units near the water treatment plant on Doolittle Drive above the hospital has been shelved indefinitely.The city already spent almost $1 million in creating a site plan, architectural designs and construction drawings, along with feasibility studies and neighborhood outreach for Water Place Housing Phase II.Those  when Aspen City Council approved contracts with architectural firms 359 Design and Roland + Broughton, along with Concept One Group as construction manager and advisor, to do the preliminary work on the project.“Over a period of years the design team has gotten deeper into the details with geotechnical work, site plans and traffic studies,” said Scott Miller, the city’s public works director.A draft conceptual site plan was presented to council in spring 2020, but then work stopped when the pandemic hit.At the time, City Manager Sara Ott told council that there wasn’t enough capacity for staff to continue with the project as the municipal government had to shift into response and recovery mode with the onset of COVID-19.“I recall very clearly Sara saying we have too much going on and there was no capacity to move it forward,” said Councilwoman Rachel Richards.Now the issue is that the fund that would pay for it doesn’t have enough money available for what could be a $50 million project, with construction and labor costs being so high, according to Miller.The 505 fund, which pays specifically for city employee housing and is funded in part by each department in the municipal government paying into it annually, is forecasted to have $3.45 million in it by the end of the year and $14 million in 2027. a certain percentage of its budget into the 505 fund every year. It grows about $2 million annually. The fund balance typically is between $3 million and $4 million.That’s clearly not enough to cover the $1 million per unit needed to build deed-restricted housing in the Aspen area.“In each budget deliberation, it comes up at least once,” Miller said, adding the city is always “trying to  as we can.”The city last month entered into  for two condos in Snowmass Village and at the Airport Business Center to add to its roughly 60 units dedicated to employee housing for its employees.The plan in 2018 and 2019 was to  near the Thomas Reservoir on a parcel in the Water Place development where the city has about two dozen homes for employees already.“We did make a presentation about density and then postponed the project, but the high-level conceptual work is done, and we could go back to council with some options to develop it with much less density,” said Rob Schober, the city’s capital asset director.Water Place was constructed in 1998 by the city on land it owns, and the parcel considered for development is located to the north of the water facilities property in challenging terrain.“I’ve always wondered if there are better opportunities than that location,” Richards said. “But I absolutely support moving forward with the concept.”Most of the employees who live in Water Place are considered essential workers, including police officers, first responders and utility personnel.Miller said the city’s long-range goal is to house 60% of its workforce, which is roughly 320 employees.“The project is on hold but on the horizon,” he said.",11.07.2022,Carolyn Sackariason,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/city-of-aspens-plans-for-new-employee-housing-shelved-since-pandemic-began/
Aspen officials busy filling voids in organization’s top positions,['https://cdn.aspentimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/07/Citylogo-atd-050518.jpeg'],"City of Aspen administrators are in the process of recruiting six department heads, which is proving challenging amid a housing and labor shortage.The exodus of that many directors leaving their helms is a result of retirements and resignations in the past few months.Leadership is needed in IT, golf and the building, recreation, child care and police departments.Assistant City Manager Diane Foster said the municipal government is close in hiring a manager for the golf and IT departments, with interviews for finalists scheduled this week.Like most local employers, the city is having difficulty finding candidates who are willing to relocate and pay exorbitant housing costs in the Roaring Fork Valley.Foster said of the eight people who interviewed for the golf manager position, two dropped out because of housing.The issue is one of the first topics of discussion in the interview process.“Just as a matter of course, we now talk to every candidate about housing,” Foster said. “We have to have those conversations.”The city has close to 60 housing units for municipal workers, and most of them are occupied with current employees.“There are times where we have interim housing available,” Foster said, noting that a recently hired housing policy analyst for the Aspen-Pitkin County Housing Authority will live in a Marolt Ranch apartment but only until January, because it’s seasonal and is set aside for Aspen Skiing Co. employees.The city is holding a housing unit open for the future IT director, Foster said.“We decide (through policy) on who gets temporary or permanent housing opportunities based on position,” she said. “Cops are super-high priority.”There is no available housing for the future golf manager or director of Kids First, the latter of which is a department that manages the city’s taxpayer-funded child care program.That may change depending on timing of the hires, and there could be temporary housing available, which is typically six months.“If you can give people a head start, it is really helpful,” Foster said.City administrators are not only interviewing finalists for the IT and golf positions this week but also conducting screening interviews for candidates for a recreation manager, who oversees the Aspen Recreation Center and rec programs.Two of the bigger shoes to fill are that of Kids First Director Shirley Ritter and Aspen Police Chief Richard Pryor, both of whom recently announced their retirements after decades on the job.The city plans to hire a recruiter to find the next police chief and will look at proposals from firms this week, according to Alissa Farrell, the city’s administrative services director.The city has not finalized its recruitment plan for the Kids First director but hopes to do so in the coming weeks.City officials hope to have someone hired for Kids First by this fall and Pryor’s replacement in place by the time he steps down in December.Screening interviews have been completed for the chief building official position, which has been held for decades by Stephen Kanipe. Finalists will be determined shortly, according to Courtney DeVito, the city’s director of human resources.There have been other movements within departments in the past couple of years with some longtime employees retiring, and the city has had to pivot to fill those voids.“It’s all about workforce planning,” Farrell said. “It doesn’t even have to be in the same department, you are looking at citywide skills and bringing staff over to other departments. …“We are continuing to look at the legacy of these long-term directors and their accomplishments and then where do we move forward and how do we make enhancements and improvements for the community and for the betterment of the organization?”The city recently restructured the parking and transportation departments as both of its directors left last year, promoting from within and changing job responsibilities.“There was an opportunity to reassess and look at some synergies between the departments,” Farrell said.Foster said it makes sense for the parking and transportation departments to be combined.“It was really intentional that those are areas that should be aligned or coordinated,” she said.Foster, who came into the organization in 2020, has had her fill of filling vacancies with the abrupt resignations of the directors of the Wheeler Opera House and APCHA just months before and after she took the job.It took a year to fill those vacancies with the help of recruiting firms, and current staff and Foster had to step in to do the work and continue the programs in those departments during the void.Foster also had to, within months of her hiring, address the retirement of Jeff Woods, the longtime manager of parks and recreation, which was filled by Austin Weiss, the city’s former parks and open space director.Foster said looking for talent within the organization is key.“People development is a big thing for me,” she said. “Private sector companies that make stuff spend about 30% of their operating budget on people, and organizations like local government, 80% of our operating costs are people.”",12.07.2022,Carolyn Sackariason,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/aspen-officials-busy-filling-voids-in-organizations-top-positions/

"Officials, community consider library expansion in Snowmass Village",['https://cdn.aspentimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/08/AT_AT201210120729934AR.jpg'],"Bookworms in Snowmass Village won’t find one central location in the town for Pitkin County Library services. Instead, there’s a pick-up at the Snowmass Recreation Center in Town Park, a dropbox at the Snowmass Center 2 miles up the road, a collection of “honor books” and a public computer and printer at Town Hall and a spot for story times at The Collective in Base Village. That could change, though, as Pitkin County Library representatives and Snowmass Village residents eye a possible expansion — and, in turn, a consolidation — of library services in the village. A few library officials met with the Snowmass Village Town Council at a regular council meeting Monday to talk through the concept; council members were largely receptive to the idea.“It would be similar to what we have in Aspen, which is a very dynamic space,” assistant library director Genevieve Smith said. “The community’s needs are always changing, and the library is able to change with it.”Ideally, the Snowmass facility would be at least 2,000 square feet with a preferred size in the 5,000 to 8,000 square feet ballpark, according to an Aprilfrom consultant James LaRue that was included in this week’s council packet. By comparison, the central Pitkin County Library in Aspen is 38,774 square feet; the “scaled back” size in Snowmass Village takes into account “limitations in space and staffing,” the report states.The location could likely be in Town Park, since there are “significant interest (and many advantages)” in a shared facility with the Snowmass Recreation Center, the report states.The idea for library expansion has been years in the making: Town Manager Clint Kinney said it emerged during the 2017 Town Council goal-setting process.And in July 2021, Kinney sent a to ask the library to budget for and fund a feasibility study for a Snowmass Village expansion. The town would be willing to consider contributing land at the Snowmass Recreation Center for a facility, Kinney wrote in the letter to library director Kathy Chandler.The library funded the study, which took place earlier this year and included a meeting between the consultant and Chandler, two meetings with library staff (one included some board members too) and two public outreach sessions, according to LaRue’s report. The general consensus is that there is a desire for a core of library services in Snowmass Village, as well as a desire for a community feel and for meeting spaces that are open to the public. Library Board of Trustees President John Wilkinson, who lives in Snowmass Village, told the council Tuesday night that the vision might look similar to the Mesa County branch library at the Fruita Recreation Center. Kinney worked on that initiative back when he was the town manager in Fruita.The local expansion would be a joint project between the town of Snowmass Village, the Snowmass Recreation Center and the Pitkin County Library.“We want to be able to have a place where the community can gather without having any problem of having to pay anything or be anywhere at any one time,” Wilkinson told the council. “This would be a free facility for all to use.” Library director Chandler emphasized the importance of accessibility at the meeting, too. “One thing about libraries is they really attempt to level the playing field for people — like people that have nothing can come in and use computers and get access to online forms to be able to apply for jobs and things,” Chandler said. “And I think that’s important, every place that you go.”As for the cost of building the expansion, library officials haven’t pinpointed a hard number yet; Wilkinson also acknowledged that sky-high construction costs right now may pose a challenge.LaRue’s report does include some estimates for a Snowmass Village library expansion. Based on a projected construction cost of $700 per square foot, a 2,000-square-foot space would cost about $1.4 million to build; on the larger (and pricier) end, a 8,000-square-foot facility would cost about $5.6 million to build. Those totals don’t include the cost of furniture, fixtures or equipment, which the report estimates would cost about 10% of the construction costs. According to the report, the Pitkin County Library has saved up about $4 million that could go toward construction. But the biggest expense, to the tune of about 60% of the library’s total annual spending, is staffing. “The key cost of libraries is not construction, it is operations,” the report states.With “little capacity” to expand staffing in Snowmass Village to a level that would be on par with the Aspen location, the report suggests that sharing staff for supervision, public meetings, circulation and other library needs would be “essential.”",07.07.2022,Kaya Williams,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/officials-community-consider-library-expansion-in-snowmass-village/

Cooper traffic experiment on one of the busiest two-block sections in downtown.While the project has been in the works since last year, the removal of 44 parking spaces and the installation of a bike lane along Galena and Cooper avenues late last month took business owners, shoppers and residents by surprise.The city’s customer service hotline for the project and general email account has been inundated since the bike lane was installed and angle parking in the area changed to parallel.“We’ve identified as a team a real need to enhance our outreach and communication that was planned for this project, and we are working on how best to do that,” said Kathleen Wanatowicz, principal of Project Resource Studio, a public relations firm hired by the city to help with the project.She made a presentation last week to the city’s Commercial Core and Lodging Commission, asking its board members to help collect data and communicate with businesses and residents during the duration of the living lab, which is scheduled to end Sept. 26.Wanatowicz said last week that there were over 30 calls to the hotline from people stating that they had no idea when the project was going to start, and they want the parking back and don’t feel a dedicated bike lane is necessary.The city engineering department, with the direction of Aspen City Council, made the changes to improve  in the downtown core.“One of the goals of this project is to provide equitable space for all users,” said PJ Murray, the city’s project manager, who told the CCLC board that 70% of the downtown is dedicated to cars. “Staff and council, we are hearing the community asking for safety to be improved in the core.”Last year the city did a community survey in which the majority of 400 respondents said they wanted more safety measures downtown for pedestrians and cyclists.Council’s desire and direction to staff for the past several years is to prioritize pedestrian and bicyclists and find ways to reduce the number of cars coming into town.“We have a real problem in the community,” said Deputy City Engineer Pete Rice, noting that traffic coming in and out of town on the Castle Creek Bridge and through the West End neighborhood is not sustainable. “There’s a lot of single vehicle reliance right now.”CCLC board member Amanda Tanaka said during last week’s meeting that she often feels unsafe when walking with her child in downtown Aspen.“I applaud the parallel parking,” she said. “I think the line of sight is so much easier.”Members of the CCLC and the business community said removing parking spaces in front of their storefronts hurts their bottom lines and makes it inconvenient for their customers.“By deferring to bikes in the core, you are hurting shoppers, older people, younger people, people with families that want to come park their car safely and do some shopping and visit the mall, go to the fountain and not having to deal with getting hit with a bike,” said CCLC board member Charles Cunniffe, who is an architect with an office downtown and has been hit more than once by a bicyclist while walking. “I think that is totally the wrong direction to go, personally.”The city has replaced the 44 parking spaces by reclassifying others just outside of the core from residential to paid, but people must walk a few more blocks to get to the core.Kenny Smith, co-owner of Meridian Jewelers, said he has met with city officials and gone to meetings about the project, but there has never been a formal process for people to publicly comment about it.“It felt disingenuous,” he said last week. “I spoke my mind that this was going to be harmful. … People are really upset and discontent on the front lines out here, and it’s creating negative energy.”There are 10 businesses in the area where the dedicated bikeway and parallel parking is that are gathering signatures from people expressing their displeasure with the pilot program.Smith said he plans to submit those petitions to council during Tuesday’s regular meeting.“In the spirit that this is real feedback,” he said.Angi Wang, a commercial real estate broker and a board member of CCLC, agreed that there was a not a lot of opportunity to weigh in during the public process.“During work sessions we were not able to give our public remarks,” she said during the CCLC meeting. “They asked businesses to show up to the work sessions, and they wouldn’t hear us out, so that is a frustration I am hearing across the board.”City officials acknowledge that they did not personally contact every single person in the downtown core, but a letter was mailed to 700 people who live in the project area.“Some of the other comments that we’ve received are that people don’t read the local paper, they don’t read their email, they don’t check their mail and so there is a handful of people that really would like to be communicated one-on-one, face-to-face individually, which is very challenging for the city of Aspen to accomplish that expectation and reach every single person,” Wanatowicz said.The city recently hired someone who will be responsible for downtown services and interaction with businesses so in the future, face-to-face communication is more likely.CCLC board member and hotelier Terry Butler said it’s not that difficult to do, as she has done in the past with other endeavors.“It really is the most effective way,” she said.CCLC board chair Jeb Ball said he has seen city officials work directly with business owners, and it works better than any other communication method.“I absolutely have seen that the face-to-face is the gold standard, and I know it’s time consuming, but I think a little ounce of prevention is really necessary, because it’s been my observation that when the city does things and it had a great outreach campaign, the event takes place, and then it’s a nuclear explosion, people going, ‘I had no idea about this, what, what, what,’ whereas if you contact the business owners in advance then they can’t say after it’s implemented, ‘Oh, I didn’t know anything about it,’” he said.Denise White, the city’s director of communications, said the surprise element of the Galena Cooper living lab is a common theme the municipal government is hearing from people.She said the city did a lot of public engagement from last August until February, but then as the project drew near, not enough communication was made as officials were in the thick of planning.“We recognize that we need to do better during the quiet months,” she said. “Things aren’t real for people until they are real.”People reacting or trying to get involved at the  is not a new phenomenon in the arena of public policy, and it makes public outreach a challenge.“I think things can get missed, and we also recognize there is a lot going on,” White said. “We have to figure out how to get the message out at the right time.”Data is being collected during the living lab, which is a test to see if it’s something that should become permanent or discontinued.The city has an intern on the ground making observations on how the roadway is being used and how motorists, pedestrians and bicyclists are interacting.One-on-one interviews are occurring, and outreach will continue for the next two months.Wanatowicz tasked CCLC board members to each connect with five people to get specific feedback, find out their preferences for city communications and to experience the two blocks as a pedestrian, a motorist and cyclist.City officials and Wanatowicz will go back to CCLC next month for an update.People wanting to learn more about the project or give an opinion can visit or call the customer service line at 970-340-4334.",11.07.2022,Carolyn

"With November elections looming, BOCC bans concealed handguns at polling places, elsewhere",['https://cdn.aspentimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/03/election-atd-110916-57.jpg'],"Whether in open view or concealed from plain sight, handguns are now banned within 100 feet of ballot boxes, voting booths and other places in Pitkin County. County commissioners Wednesday adopted an ordinance that temporarily outlaws concealed handguns within 100 feet of polling places, as well as the Pitkin County Administration and Sheriff’s Office Building. The 5-0 decision came after Gov. Jared Polis signed into law on March 30 the banning the open carry of firearms within 100 feet of polling places and election centers.It’s legislation that took effect ahead of June primaries and November midterm elections. The new law drew no support from Republican lawmakers.While the state law applies to firearms, the county law bans solely handguns. The county modeled its ordinance in part from Colorado law that allows local government to enact legislation prohibiting concealed handguns in buildings that are under the local jurisdiction. “I would like it to be all weapons that are not allowed within the administration building and the sheriff’s building and the voting centers, rather than just concealed handguns,” said Commissioner Francie Jacober, adding the Pitkin County Sheriff’s Office doesn’t allow outsiders with weapons of any type.   Because commissioners approved the ordinance on first reading June 21, they could not amend it ahead of their confirmation vote, said county attorney John Ely. “My recommendation is to confirm this ordinance so that it remains in place and to discuss further limitations,” he told commissioners, earlier noting “the only action that we can take on this … ordinance is either to confirm it or not to confirm it.”Banning weapons altogether poses challenges, Ely said. “The broad term ‘weapon’ is a is a difficult term to focus on,” he said. “Almost anything can be weaponized, so that’s why it’s a difficult term to include in a prohibition, and a prohibition that we establish under the law must be clear and not vague to the public, so that someone would clearly know when and when not they are violating the law.”A future BOCC work session, Ely said, could be held “to have a further discussion about not only weapons, but any other type of restrictions that the board is interested in pursuing.” Restrictions considered could include the sale of fully automatic weapons, military-style weapons and high-capacity magazines. “I’d support this to come back,” Commissioner Kelly McNicholas Kury said. “After we talked about this, I’ve noticed (Roaring Fork Transportation Authority) has a prohibition on weapons as does the city on their properties as well, so this actually might make things more consistent.”The county’s temporary ban on concealed weapons at polling places and the county headquarters and sheriff’s building is the result of increased concern about safety at polling places. On Jan. 26, the  it was looking into more than 850 reported threats against election officials. As well, the Pitkin County Administration and Sheriff’s Office Building was placed on lockdown for two days in April 2021 after officials received threatening emails. Though the incident did not appear to be politically or election related, a  that in “today’s climate, with everything going on in our society, we are not going to downplay this. We take these threats seriously.”The BOCC’s emergency ordinance said in part the board “believes that the conduct of fair and open elections should be absent any threats or intimidation to the electorate” and that the “BOCC intends to protect its staff, volunteers and the community and the BOCC intends to maintain facilities that are safe and free of violence.” First-time violators face a fine of $50 and up to $1,000 for subsequent infractions. Violators who refuse to leave the premises faces jail time of up to six months, according to the ordinance.

Three victims in Independence Pass hostage case awarded $1.4 million,['https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=5b011156-91a3-553c-95ae-dd4d4a2621a4&type=preview&width=620&height=413&q=60'],"A District Court judge has awarded $1.4 million to three men who were held hostage at gunpoint by a delusional Colorado Springs real estate agent on Independence Pass nearly six years ago.The amount was the maximum allowed under Colorado law for “non-economic losses” that includes emotional distress and pain suffering, though it fell short of the $2.25 million sought from Brolin McConnell by the three men.“We’re really happy with this,” Michael Fox, the Aspen-based lawyer for the three men, said Monday. “Ultimately, whether they got $2.25 million or $1.4 million, it doesn’t matter. My clients … are just looking to close this chapter in their lives.”Ninth Judicial District Judge John Neiley, who is based in Glenwood Springs, entered the award late Friday afternoon after a March 21 during which Brian Buchanan, Mark Meredith and Blake Ramelb testified about the lasting trauma McConnell inflicted on them during the incident on .McConnell did not participate in the virtual trial last week, though Neiley found that McConnell had received notice of the trial and even waited an extra 10 minutes for him to log on before beginning the proceedings.In his ruling, Neiley wrote that the men — who were in the their early-to-mid 20s at the time — demonstrated during their testimony “that they suffered significant emotional and psychological injuries and severe emotional distress as a direct and proximate result of McConnell’s conduct.”“He held them at gunpoint and completely terrorized them,” Neiley said. “The conduct was so outrageous in character and so extreme in degree as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency and must be regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.”Under Colorado law, the maximum allowed in nonmedical malpractice civil cases for noneconomic loss or injury is $250,000, “unless the court finds ‘justification’ by clear and convincing evidence to award a greater amount,” Neiley said in his ruling. The current cap for those maximum damages is $468,010, which he awarded to each of the three plaintiffs, because of the severity of McConnell’s conduct, according to the ruling.Neiley declined to award more because higher amounts generally come only with loss of limbs, loss of senses “or other similar physically traumatic injuries.”“While the court does not mean to minimize the emotional trauma suffered by the Plaintiffs, none of them suffered permanent physical injuries or disfigurement, lost a limb or suffered a gunshot wound,” Neiley said. “With appropriate therapy and counseling, there is significant hope that the emotional impacts of the incident can be ameliorated over time.”Buchanan and Meredith first encountered McConnell’s stopped truck on Lincoln Creek Road on their way to do some bouldering and camping. McConnell pulled out two handguns, made them partially disrobe and repeatedly threatened to kill them before they were able to escape without injury.Ramelb drove up on the scene and was also taken hostage. McConnell fired one of the guns at Ramelb’s feet and also next to his head before he, too, was able to escape without injury despite having recently had surgery on his foot.After spending 3½ years awaiting trial in the Pitkin County Jail — which included numerous delays after he pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity and was eventually found sane —  to criminal attempt to commit first-degree kidnapping and felony menacing.Pitkin County District Judge Chris Seldin, who said McConnell was experiencing “paranoid delusions” when he held the men hostage, sentenced him to 12 years in prison in March 2020. McConnell served less than two years before he was released on parole in January and is currently living in Texas.Efforts to collect the $1.4 million can come in the form of garnishing wages, bank accounts or real property, Fox said.",29.03.2022,Jason Auslander,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/three-victims-in-independence-pass-hostage-case-awarded-1-4-million/
Dillon voters likely to see short-term rental ballot measures,[],"Voters in the town of Dillon will likely decide in November whether to impose a 6% lodging tax and 5% excise tax on short-term rentals. Neither number is finalized, but the council voiced support for putting the question on the November ballot at its work session Tuesday.The councilors present voiced unanimous support for the taxes after seeing the results of Silverthorne and Frisco’s votes.  with 74.6% of voters in favor, and  with 64% of voters in favor. Frisco also has a 2% lodging tax in addition to the excise tax.Including the 8.875% sales tax, short-term rentals in Dillon would be subject to 19.875% in taxes. Hotels would be exempt of the 5% excise tax. Town Manager Nathan Johnson said the largest excise tax in Colorado was 15% in Ouray.The money generated from the taxes would go toward the town. Councilors listed a number of avenues for the money, from workforce housing to roads and transportation, and from town core projects to general infrastructure. Enterprise funds like the marina would be ineligible, town finance director Carri Mcdonnell explained.“But it could be put into other improvements which might free up money for the marina,” she said.

Johnson said that in conversation with renters, he learned they want to see a correlation between the tax and improvements in the town.Mayor Carolyn Skowyra said, “I like the language Silverthorne used,” referencing the wording of Silverthorne’s ballot question. Their question stated the money would go to addressing visitor impacts on recreation, public safety, transportation and housing.“I’m a strong supporter of myself, because I think the short-term rentals situation has created some problems like workforce housing,” Councilor Dana Christensen said. “So if we can have those same people help solve problems by generating revenue we could use for workforce housing.”“I agree with Dana,” Councilor Renee Imamura added. “And not just for workforce housing, but for other town improvements.”Councilor Tony Scalise offered the council’s lone concern, saying, “I just want to make sure, with companies that are existing because of short-term rentals, we don’t take a big chunk out of them.”“And they don’t want a cap,” Councilor Renee Imamura added. Dillon does not have a moratorium on the number of short-term rentals allowed.Currently, short-term rentals are subject to a 2% lodging tax, in addition to an 8.875% sales tax. The sales tax would remain in effect if voters approved the new lodging and excise tax rates.Renters must also  and pay a $250 fee. The fee covers a complaint hotline and staff time. In line with Silverthorne, Dillon also caps the number of occupants at two per bedroom, plus two.The council has until August to settle on its exact language for the ballot. The council indicated it would place two questions for approval on the ballot, one for the excise tax and one for the new lodging tax.While approved, Silverthorne’s lodging tax change does not take effect until July 1. Frisco expects to generate $1.5 million in revenue from its excise tax from Jan. 1 to Dec. 31, 2023.

The spill ultimately resulted in about 2 million gallons of water flowing into Mill and Gore creeks.In a Sept. 21 investigation, Colorado Parks and Wildlife found water with a “bluish-white” tint where the system flowed into Mill Creek at a culvert near Vail’s Pirate Ship Park. The spill was visible on Gore Creek to a site just downstream of the Willow Bridge in Vail Village.The investigation discovered 120 dead fish. The investigation also revealed dead algae and dead macroinvertebrates including worms and stoneflies.According to the report, water in the snowmaking pond had been treated with a “granular copper-based algaecide.” In addition, the potable water flowing into the pond is treated with chlorine.The report refers to Vail Resorts as “Vail Corporation,” and notes that the spill qualifies as a “discharge of pollutants,” and that the company doesn’t have permits for any such discharge into Mill Creek.The notice also includes several steps of “required corrective action” including:The order states that Vail Corp. must answer the findings and submit an answer within 30 days.Vail Resorts replied to the notice with the following statement:“Vail Mountain provided a comprehensive response to (the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment) regarding the circumstances of the accidental discharge last fall which included immediate measures to ensure that the potable water discharge would not happen again in the future, and we continue to cooperate with (the department) on this matter. We are still awaiting a final Colorado Parks and Wildlife report on the cause of the fish kill that occurred in Mill Creek at the time of the discharge.”A valve on part of the Vail Mountain snowmaking system was opened the afternoon of Sept. 17, 2021.Another valve was also open, allowing potable water to run into the system.That water — approximately 2 million gallons — flowed into Mill Creek and then Gore Creek.The discharge lasted until Sept. 20.The result was a significant fish kill in Gore Creek.",20.05.2022,Scott Miller,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/state-issues-vail-resorts-a-notice-of-violation-for-2021-fish-kill/
Moose tramples trail runner in Breckenridge,['https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=9773b35d-0bbd-5d42-9489-a8830a26ce51&type=preview&width=4608&height=3456&q=60'],"Colorado Parks and Wildlife reports that a female moose trampled a woman in Breckenridge on Thursday, May 26.Jacob Kay, district wildlife manager for Parks and Wildlife, said in a news release that the woman was running on the Campion Trail around 9:15 a.m. and was focused on her feet when she crossed paths with the moose. The moose had its calf with her, so it is likely that the animal felt threatened by the runner.“When she looked up, she saw the moose, which immediately charged her and eventually trampled her,” Kay said.The woman was able to hike out and drive herself home, where she called Parks and Wildlife officers to report the incident. A trail closure for the Campion Trail (Forest Service Trail #9021) has been put in place through Wednesday, June 1. Wildlife officers will continue to assess the area over the weekend and are hopeful the trail will reopen next week.Moose are more likely to live in areas located near water with an abundance of willows, which is their primary food source. Parks and Wildlife officials are encouraging the public to be aware of their surroundings when recreating outdoors. That is especially true when they are with pets such as dogs, Kay said — moose react to dogs the same way they would react to a predator in the wild, which typically means standing their ground and acting defensive.“If you encounter a moose, give it space and time to move,” the Parks and Wildlife release continued. “Do not attempt to haze the moose out of the way. Not only is it dangerous, but this is also considered harassment and is illegal. If a moose has laid-back ears, pawing the ground, licks its snout, or changes its direction to face you, you’re too close and need to back away.” ",31.05.2022,,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/moose-tramples-trail-runner-in-breckenridge/

He and his son, Max, have created a partial answer.On the third floor of the Alliance Moving Systems warehouse in Gypsum is The Downvalley Attic, a roughly 1,800-square-foot space that can serve any number of functions.There’s enough staircase landing space for a grill. Inside is a kitchen, a bathroom, a stage big enough for a full band and sound and lighting systems suitable for everything from small-space concerts to sports watch parties.All the furnishings have come from Alliance’s vast collection of donated items. There’s a love seat that once sat in the study of President Gerald Ford’s Beaver Creek home. There’s a pool table, a vintage jukebox, and enough tables and chairs to suit just about any need. There’s also memorabilia from Vail’s long hockey history, and golf clubs and vintage album covers adorn the walls.The memorabilia isn’t all from donations to Alliance. A guest recently noticed the jukebox, and a few days later showed up with some records that can be loaded into the machine. One is from Elvis Presley.There’s also a propeller from what had to be a very small plane, but it’s World War II vintage, and in pristine condition.Items include just about every jersey you can imagine from Vail’s hockey history, along with framed photos and newspaper clippings featuring people associated with those teams and clubs.Clark said the space has only recently been finished, but it’s already hosted a handful of events. There are album release events coming for local groups that have recorded music at Maxed Out Sound, the recording studio on the second floor.Clark is also thinking bigger, with an eye toward youth and other community groups. Clark said the idea is to make The Downvalley Attic accessible to those who want to provide positive messages to local youth, and perhaps involve local police.“I want to break down that natural apprehensiveness” between kids and cops, Clark said.This isn’t a public space — you have to reserve it through Clark. If your group wants adult beverages at an event, that group has to hire a trained and certified bartender and carry liability insurance.But the space is there, it’s available, and it’s pretty neat.A corporate event would have to rent the space, Clark said. There’s enough audio-visual equipment to host just about any kind of training presentation. But youth groups including the local Young Life chapter can use the space without charge.“My hope is local businesses could sponsor” local youth groups, Clark said. “My real motive is to get kids and families a place to gather,” he added. “This isn’t about profit.”The Attic is a classic example of “mission creep,” Clark said. The project started with Clark and his son, Max, building Maxed Out Sound, the recording studio on the warehouse’s second floor.That studio is fully equipped with keyboards — including a magnificent-sounding baby grand piano, drums, microphones, amplifiers and recording equipment. There are isolation rooms for vocals or acoustic guitar parts.Max Clark has put the studio to good use for his own country music recordings, and he has worked with friends for music, podcasts and voiceover work.When the studio was complete, Andy Clark climbed a ladder up to the third floor and thought, “We could really do something with this.”The Downvalley Attic is the result.Alliance Moving Systems is hosting a giant June 11 parking lot sale at its warehouse at 375 Spring Buck Road in Gypsum.Alliance owner Andy Clark said the sale is leftover stuff from the Home to Home program, in which the company provides donated home furnishings and housewares to those who have lost their possessions in mudslides or fires. A lot of stuff has gone to locals, of course, but Alliance has also donated items to victims of the Marshall Fire in Boulder County.Clark said First Lutheran Church of Gypsum is the beneficiary of this year’s parking lot sale.“We don’t want to do big parking lot sales,” Clark said. “But we have three full trailers right now.”",06.06.2022,Scott Miller,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/regional/gypsum-now-has-space-in-the-downvalley-attic/

Although most of the events happen in and around Vail, the Minturn Bike Park will play host to this head-to-head format that will be equally as exciting to watch as it is to ride.The Minturn Bike Park opened last year and set the stage for this style of bike racing to be a part of the GoPro Mountain Games. The Vail Valley Foundation and GoPro have partnered with the town of Minturn, the Vail Valley Mountain Trails Alliance and Strait Acres to create this exciting new event.Strait Acres is owned by pro rider couple Kyle and Rachel Strait. Kyle was out putting the finishing touches on the course while Rachel was taking care of their 15-month-old daughter.“The bike park crew has really done a great job of building the footprint, and then Kyle is just putting his little touches on it,” Rachel Strait said.Based out of Alpine, California, a small town east of San Diego, both Rachel and Kyle grew up in Southern California and have been pro riders for most of their lives.“Kyle went pro when he was 16, and I went pro when I was a little older. He does the Red Bull Rampage event every year and was the first guy to win that event twice, and he is the only athlete that has participated in every single one of them. He’s crazy!” Strait said. “I keep waiting for the day when he says, ‘Yeah, babe, I think I’m done,’ but he’s not slowing down.”This will be the Straits’ first trip to the GoPro Mountain Games. The Straits will be joined by other top talents on the dual slalom circuit.“We’ll have Bubba Warren here. Tommy Zula, who is the pump track world champion, will be here. And Collin Hudson is a very fast racer from Colorado,” Strait said.Top female racers will be here as well.“Look for pump track world champion Kialani Hines, and Jordy Scott is a really fast racer out of Utah, so it will be a good competition,” Strait said.Top prize money will be handed out, which is important to the Straits.“Our whole goal is to make sure we give back to the racers, because without racers, you wouldn’t have anything, so it was really cool that the Vail Valley Foundation understood our vision and were able to come up with really good prize money for this event,” Strait said.The pro/open men’s and women’s divisions boasts a prize purse of $12,000. Professional racers will be here as well as amateurs, so expect to find a few locals in the mix, too.The qualifying rounds happen on Tuesday, and qualifying rounds and finals wrap up on Wednesday. Racers will be out there all day, and there will be plenty of places to spectate. After the awards at 6:30 p.m. Wednesday, stick around for a free concert at the Little Beach Amphitheater, which is near the Minturn Bike Park at 7 p.m.For more information on the 20th GoPro Mountain Games and the GoPro Dual Slalom, go to .",07.06.2022,,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/the-gopro-dual-slalom-bike-race-makes-its-debut-at-gopro-mountain-games/
Garfield County commissioners step up opposition to Sweetwater state park plan,['https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=be133a74-0945-50be-aa1d-932ace0e8d7e&type=preview&width=3600&height=2400&q=60'],"Garfield County commissioners are doubling down in opposing plans to turn Sweetwater Lake north of Dotsero into a state park.If they can make a legal argument, the county may even take it to court, Commissioner Tom Jankovsky suggested during a sometimes heated work session meeting with Eagle Valley Land Trust representatives on Tuesday.“You should feel remorse, because this is bulls—,” Jankovsky said, questioning the EVLT’s conservation goals via its “Save the Lake” campaign, if the U.S. Forest Service, as the new owner of the Sweetwater Lake property, and Colorado Parks and Wildlife proceed with development of a new state park.“What’s happening is contrary to your goals and mission, and will be more impactful than a private development would be,” Jankovsky said. “I don’t think putting a campground up there is protecting these lands.”The commissioners have contended that, even though in 2019 they gave verbal support — on a 2-1 vote, with Jankovsky opposed — to the efforts to place the property in the public trust, a state park was never envisioned as the ultimate outcome.The county has asked to be party to the upcoming federally required environmental analysis of the state park proposal, and have called for a full-blown Environmental Impact Statement under the National Environmental Policy Act.EVLT Executive Director Jessica Foulis and Deputy Director Bergen Tjossem were invited to the Tuesday work session to explain the nonprofit land conservation organization’s involvement in the land transaction.EVLT spearheaded the Save the Lake campaign, which was successful in raising just over $1 million, including about half from Eagle County and the rest from private donations, various foundation grants and smaller local government contributions, Tjossem said.Following the $8.5 million purchase in August 2021 using a major grant from the federal Land and Water Conservation Fund, and transfer of the property from the Conservation Fund to the U.S. Forest Service, EVLT began working with the Forest Service and CPW on the next steps.CPW had signed on in support of the Save the Lake campaign, but didn’t become formally involved until those “next steps” turned to how best to manage the 488-acre lake and surrounding land and the various buildings that have been used as a private resort and outfitters’ operation, Bergen said.Though the EVLT is not directly involved in the park planning, it does control the remaining $133,300 from the Save the Lake campaign to pay for some of the needed upgrades to the buildings and other infrastructure.“We can’t fund anything that the landowner (Forest Service) doesn’t agree to,” Bergen said.Still, he and Foulis beared the brunt Tuesday of the county commissioners’ escalating ire over the situation, which has rankled residents of the area who say they don’t want a state park and even some donors to the campaign who said they wouldn’t have given to the effort if they thought a state park was to be the outcome.“I’ve had numerous emails and personal contact with people who are sick and scared to death of what’s happening up there in their community,” Commissioner Mike Samson said.Samson said that when he and fellow Commissioner John Martin voted to lend their verbal support to Save the Lake, they never intended it to be a state park.“I’d like to say maybe (EVLT) is caught in the middle of all this … but I don’t think people who were behind Save the Lake wanted this to become a state park,” Samson said. “We need to totally back up here; we’re way ahead of things, and we need some solid answers about how this transpired.”Martin said he questions the logic behind the funding scheme, including use of some state lottery funds, and called it a “shell game.”Jankovsky was more blunt, calling the evolution of the deal from raising money to add Sweetwater Lake to the White River National Forest holdings to turning it into a state park a “bait and switch.”Bergen took issue with that assessment.“Do we have remorse? No, this wasn’t a bait and switch,” he said. “We set out to purchase a private property and put it in public hands, and we accomplished that.”Contributing to the county commissioners’ concerns is the uncertain fate of the private operator, Adrian Brink of AJ Brink Outfitters, who has been told by the Forest Service that some of the buildings she uses for her operation are in disrepair and cannot be inhabited until repairs are made or they can be replaced.“We aren’t doing anything that we weren’t permitted to do before, except that an inspection of the buildings came back saying they’re in pretty poor condition,” said Brink, who met later in the day with Forest Service officials to work out an interim plan.“There is a unique experience for people here that we want to preserve,” she said. “There has been something there for over 100 years, in the same fashion as what we’ve done, and we feel that should be preserved.”White River National Forest Supervisor Scott Fitzwilliams said in a follow-up interview that he thinks they can work out a reasonable plan. But there will be some challenges, because that liability is now on the federal government, and not a private landowner, Fitzwilliams said.“The lodge is not inhabitable,” he said. “There are gaping holes, there’s mold, there are electrical problems …“These are government facilities now, for which I take on the liability.”While the Forest Service could close off access to the buildings altogether, he said a “temporary solution” involving some basic upgrades to make at least some of them usable, appears doable.“We are trying to get it so they can run their operation,” Fitzwilliams said. “It will be a challenge, but in the long run I think we can work it out.”Fitzwilliams also defended EVLT’s role in raising the initial money to purchase Sweetwater Lake and stewarding the remaining funds from that effort.“They’ve just been a vital cog and have been nothing but gracious and above-board in this,” he said. “I feel bad that they’re being accused of these things, when they should be congratulated for all the work they’re doing.”The funds held by the EVLT are going to pay for things like trash containers, restrooms, a dock and the needed building repairs, Fitzwilliams said. “Without them, we wouldn’t have a third party to leverage and assist with all that,” he said.",09.06.2022,John Stroud,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/garfield-county-commissioners-step-up-opposition-to-sweetwater-state-park-plan/
Declining levels at Lake Powell increase risk to humpback chub downstream,"['https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=c158a739-4189-532b-bea8-6aecb2efa85a&type=preview&width=4608&height=3456&q=60', 'https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=35cb99b2-f285-561d-8907-7840923f8a1d&type=preview&width=5057&height=3371&q=60', 'https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=ba4fa9c1-9d50-56e5-affb-c7c314f92f31&type=preview&width=3440&height=2298&q=60', 'https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=7ec8ba48-1e9f-5ae1-a41d-c5c9422ae39c&type=preview&width=5329&height=3548&q=60', 'https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=20b25627-240f-55b8-bb00-1b20cb7d4397&type=preview&width=474&height=539&q=60']","As climate change continues to shrink the nation’s second-largest reservoir, water managers are scrambling to prevent the release of an invasive fish into the Grand Canyon.Smallmouth bass, a voracious predator and popular game fish, have been introduced into reservoirs throughout the Colorado River basin, including Lake Powell. The looming problem now is that as lake levels drop to historically low levels, the invasive fish are likely to escape beyond Glen Canyon Dam, threatening endangered fish in the canyon, whose populations have rebounded in recent years.Smallmouth bass are a warm-water-loving species, hanging out in the top part of the water column, which is warmed by the sun. Until recently, the intakes for turbines at Glen Canyon Dam had been lower in the water column, where colder temperatures kept the fish away. But as the lake level falls, the warmer water band containing the smallmouth bass is sinking closer to the intakes, making it more likely that they will pass through the dam to the river below.Warmer water below the dam also means a more ideal environment for the bass, which thrive in temperatures above 61 degrees Fahrenheit (16 degrees Celsius).“With the levels we are expecting to get to this coming year, water temperatures are going to be warmer than they’ve been in 52 years in the Grand Canyon,” said Charles Yackulic, a research statistician with the U.S. Geological Survey’s Grand Canyon Monitoring and Research Center.The research center has been modeling the likelihood that smallmouth bass will become established below the dam under different scenarios and providing that information to decision-makers and water managers.Jack Schmidt, a Colorado River researcher at Utah State University and former director of the research center, co-wrote — along with Yackulic and others — a March 2021 paper that sounded the alarm that future warming is likely to disproportionately benefit nonnative fish species to the detriment of native species. The problem from which all others stem, including the changing fish communities, and the reason Powell is so low in the first place is the climate-change-driven, supply-demand imbalance, Schmidt said.“If we are going to continue to load the atmosphere with carbon such that the atmosphere warms and the runoff in the Colorado River keeps getting lower and if we are going to keep consuming water … then you can only play this game of staving off the inevitable for so long before it’s game over,” he said.Although the trout fishery and other native fish around Lees Ferry would also be hurt by the bass, the biggest risk would be to the fish listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), including the humpback chub.“The biggest concern for a lot of stakeholders is how it could affect humpback chub and razorback sucker,” Yackulic said. “Over 90% of humpback chub are found in the Grand Canyon reach, and they have been doing really well over the last 10 years.”So well in fact that in 2021 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service down-listed humpback chub’s status from endangered to threatened, a decision based partly on the thriving populations in the Grand Canyon. The down-listing means the chub still retains some ESA protections, but it is no longer at immediate risk of extinction.Scientists think that smallmouth bass are responsible for decimating humpback chub populations in the upper basin — for example, near Echo Park, at the confluence of the Green and Yampa rivers.“We are very concerned that if they get into the Grand Canyon, they could have a similar impact on the humpback chub and, through predation and competition, could jeopardize that new listing of being threatened,” said Melissa Trammel, a fisheries biologist with the National Parks Service. “Our efforts to try to restore that species in the canyon would definitely be impacted.”The Glen Canyon Dam Adaptive Management Program has formed a technical work group subcommittee to address the problem. Several ideas have been floated: installing a bubble curtain that could keep fish away from the dam intakes; electro-fishing and removal of smallmouth bass below the dam; selective withdrawal devices that allow dam operators to pull from different parts of the water column; or releasing colder water from the deeper jet tubes once a week to make the temperatures below the dam inhospitable to the invasive fish. This, however, would mean bypassing the turbines that make hydropower.Clarence Fullard, acting program manager for the Bureau of Reclamation’s Glen Canyon Dam Adaptive Management Program, said they are considering all options to prevent smallmouth bass from becoming established, but there is still a lot of uncertainty about a way forward.“There’s really no low-hanging fruit to prevent this,” he said. “The scale of Glen Canyon Dam and Lake Powell make it hard to come up with solutions. We don’t know what we could do operationally.”One thing that has seen some success on the Green River below Flaming Gorge Dam is something called a flow spike. A carefully timed, short, high-flow release from the reservoir can knock the fish off their nests and wash their eggs downstream. According to Trammel, this tactic has reduced the reproduction of smallmouth bass in that area by about 30%.And because of the planned releases this year from Flaming Gorge under the Drought Response Operations Plan (DROA), this spike flow is scheduled again for later this month.“The extra water being released from Flaming Gorge to go down to Powell is actually being reshaped to help endangered fishes in the upper basin,” Trammel said. “We would not have had that experimental flow this year without the DROA.”For now, members of the technical work group are creating a strategic plan, a draft of which will be released in August. Scientists will continue monitoring in places where the smallmouth bass are likely to try to establish. Each year for the past decade, Yackulic said, monitoring efforts have caught up to three smallmouth bass who made it through the turbines and ended up below the dam.“The thing about fish is for every one you catch, there’s probably quite a few you don’t catch,” he said.Still, scientists don’t think the fish have become established enough yet for there to be a reproducing population below the dam. But time is of the essence.Although the invasive-fish issue may get overshadowed by the crush of bad news surrounding the Colorado River — record-low reservoir levels, shortages, emergency federal actions, potential loss of hydropower — scientists say there is still an urgent need to act on it.“The long-term cost of trying to control that species maybe doesn’t feel as urgent as losing hydropower at Glen Canyon Dam, but once they are established, it is almost impossible to get rid of them,” Trammel said. “There’s no agency in the world that says, ‘I wish I had waited a little longer to try and control this invasive species.’”But any operational changes to combat an invasion of smallmouth bass in the Grand Canyon are likely to be just a stopgap measure.“We should never forget that the fundamental problem is much bigger than how to operate Glen Canyon Dam; it’s about the balance between watershed runoff and consumptive use,” Schmidt said. “And until we get consumptive use matching the available supply, we are always going to be flirting with disaster. We can only hold off these changes for so long before we lose the battle.”",13.06.2022,,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/declining-levels-at-lake-powell-increase-risk-to-humpback-chub-downstream/

U.S. Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Camille Touton, testifying at a U.S. Senate hearing on drought on Tuesday, said an additional 2 million to 4 million acre-feet of conservation was needed just to protect critical reservoir levels in 2023.Department of Interior Assistant Secretary for Water and Science Tanya Trujillo reiterated this position in a talk at Thursday’s Conference on Natural Resources at the University of Colorado Law School. She said the federal government has the responsibility and authority to take action to protect the system and the infrastructure if the states can’t reach an agreement on their own.“We are facing the growing reality that water supplies for agriculture, fisheries, ecosystems, industry and cities are no longer stable due to climate change,” Trujillo said. “Our collective goal is to be able to very quickly identify and implement strategies that will stabilize and rebuild the system so we don’t find ourselves constantly on the brink of a crisis.”Over the past year, water managers have implemented measures to keep water levels from falling below critical thresholds for hydropower production in the nation’s two largest reservoirs, including a plan for holding back water in Lake Powell, emergency releases from upstream reservoirs, and a much-celebrated plan to save 500,000 acre-feet in Lake Mead.The actions taken in the 2022 Drought Response Operations Plan will add about 1 million acre-feet, or 16 feet of elevation, to Lake Powell.But these actions are not enough.“It’s buying us a bit more time, but not much,” said James Prairie, the upper Colorado basin research and modeling chief for the Bureau of Reclamation.Prairie kicked off the conference by sharing numbers from the Bureau’s June 24-month study, which predicted that 2022 will be another anemic year for spring runoff into Powell at just 55% of average. Total Colorado River system storage stands at about 35% full; last year at this time it was about 42% full. In March, Lake Powell dipped below a critical threshold of 3,525 feet, just 35 feet above the minimum level needed to generate hydropower for millions of people in the southwest.The announcement of what one water expert dubbed the “2-to-4-million-acre-foot challenge” overshadowed many of the conference’s planned topics and left some presenters scrambling to change their talks or at least their tone. Debating the finer points of the Colorado River Compact, which divided the waters between the upper and lower basin states and marks its 100th anniversary this year, all of a sudden took a backseat.“Everything has changed beneath our feet with Commissioner Touton’s announcement Tuesday,” said author and conference moderator John Fleck.Touton gave the states until Aug. 16 to figure out a path to conservation before Reclamation would take unilateral action to protect the system. That’s when Reclamation’s August 24-month study comes out, which lays out a plan for how the agency will operate its reservoirs in the coming year.Federal officials made it clear that conserving the 2 million to 4 million acre-feet is the responsibility of all seven basin states: Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Wyoming, Nevada, California and Arizona. But they were not prescriptive about how to do it or how the shortages should be shared; that’s for the states to figure out among themselves.“Do we have any specific recipe in mind? The short answer is no, we don’t have a formula already pre-baked and pre-worked,” Trujillo said. “We are likely going to be in a situation of doing things we have never done before.”How Colorado will conserve is unclear, especially since the state’s exploration of a demand management program that would have paid water users to cut back has been shelved for now. The program proved a hard sell, especially for some agricultural water users who questioned why Colorado should send water to prop up Lake Powell and fix a problem that is caused by what they say is over-use in California, Nevada and Arizona.The compact divided the flows of the Colorado River equally between the upper and lower basin at 7.5 million acre-feet each. But the upper basin has never come close to using its full allocation, while the lower basin, by some estimates, uses more than 8.5 million acre-feet. Meanwhile, climate change and a two-decade-long drought have diminished river flows basin-wide in the 20th century by about 20%; scientists say about one-third of that loss can be attributed to warmer temperatures.Chuck Cullom, the executive director of the Upper Colorado River Commission, said that while all seven states share the resource of the Colorado River and have an obligation to contribute to conservation, most of the water savings should come from the lower basin.“Everyone needs to participate, but the vast majority of the effort needs to come from the lower basin, because that’s where the preponderance of the uses are,” he said.Upper basin water managers point to the emergency releases of 161,000 acre-feet last year from Blue Mesa, Flaming Gorge and Navajo reservoirs as a way they have responded to the crisis. But that decision was made unilaterally by Reclamation and is not the same as conservation.Colorado’s commissioner to the UCRC and head of the Colorado Water Conservation Board Rebecca Mitchell did not give specific examples of where Colorado could increase its water conservation, but said the state will continue to work with other basin states, the federal governments and tribal nations to find solutions.“Colorado water users are on the front lines of climate change,” Mitchell said in an emailed statement. “We are continuing to work closely with our federal and state partners across the basin to address water shortages.” Fleck ended Thursday’s session by striking an emotional tone that captured the mood in the room. We are at a moment of reckoning and realizing the West of the future will look much different than it does now, he said.“We are in a moment of grieving,” he said. “The tools we developed were not enough.”",20.06.2022,,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/race-is-on-for-colorado-river-basin-states-to-conserve-before-feds-take-action/
Meet one of the many people behind Hanging Lake’s reopening,"['https://cdn.aspentimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/06/hanginglake-atd-062722-1.jpg', 'https://cdn.aspentimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/06/hanginglake-atd-062722-2.jpeg']","Jamie Werner knew hard work would soon follow the surges of mud, rocks and debris that crashed down in Glenwood Canyon last summer.“I knew from that moment it was going to impact our community,” Werner said. “I did not know how much it was going to impact my professional life, but that became clear very quickly.”Werner, 38, is an experienced professional in environmental science who also currently sits on the board of the Watershed Biodiversity Initiative.Yet she was about five months into her new role as White River National Forest stewardship coordinator with the National Forest Foundation when a rare, 500-year rain event bore down on the Grizzly Creek burn scar in July 2021. The burn scar was, of course, a product of the Grizzly Creek Fire of 2020.This series of catastrophic debris slides not only trapped motorists but destroyed parts of Interstate 70, disrupted interstate commerce and traffic and led to the closure of Hanging Lake Trail, one of Colorado’s most prized possessions.The disaster also prompted a $116 million request for federal emergency funds. “That night, when the folks were stuck in the tunnel and the canyon was closed, it’s important to maintain a perspective on it,” Werner said. “Hanging Lake is a treasured landscape and is a very important place to all of us, but human safety is paramount.”One of her main responsibilities throughout this entire ordeal was to ensure Hanging Lake Trail recuperated and reopened. This meant tirelessly interfacing with federal, state and local leaders and officials, nonprofit organizations, local businesses, scientific researchers, trails specialists and average Colorado residents. The aim was to procure the funds necessary to restore a natural wonder and have this seemingly impossible feat accomplished as quickly as possible.“Tackling a project of the scale of the Hanging Lake Trail restoration in such an ambitious time frame would be impossible otherwise,” Werner said.The history of Hanging Lake Trail stretches back to the late 19th century. Based on legend, a man accidentally stumbled upon this cliff-side basin while searching for gold. Since then, the location eventually turned into a 1.2-mile ascent to a mountain oasis, complete with angel hair waterfalls splashing into a rocky travertine lake of emerald waters.White River National Forest Public Affairs Officer David Boyd said having someone as effective as Werner at the helm in this situation has “been amazing.”“Very often as I’m hearing about a project and I’m getting more information, they’ll say, ‘This is funded through the National Forest Foundation.’ We’re coordinating a lot,” he said. “It’s great, because (Werner’s) from the area, and she knows the area very well.“It’s been hugely helpful having her in this position.”Hanging Lake Trail wasn’t expected to reopen so soon, but that changed Friday when Gov. Jared Polis and Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., paid a visit to Glenwood Springs.Because Werner took the forefront of facilitating a contract between the U.S. Forest Service and Summit to Sea trail builders, bridges were fixed, a temporary trail was installed, and Polis and Boebert were cutting ribbon to usher in its grand reopening Friday.“(Werner) was out front on that and really making sure everything was getting done and organizing everything and just stayed in very close communication with the (Forest Service),” Boyd said.Friday was big for Werner.“It’s a massive moment for our community and not just our local community but all the folks who come back to Hanging Lake again and again,” she said. Werner said it’s also a huge moment for the economy of Glenwood Springs to have their most-visited tourist attraction back up and running.“I live here in Glenwood Springs, and so it’s a personally important project to me as well,” she said. “Since mid-April, to repair and replace three bridges, clear all that debris off the trail, is really, really remarkable.”The project is not at the finish line yet, however. Werner has her sights set on managing the upcoming $2.28 million trail redesign and reconstruction effort supported by Great Outdoors Colorado.Werner, who just purchased a new home with her husband, Jeff, in Glenwood Springs, leads a quintessentially Coloradan lifestyle. They’re either frequenting her favorite restaurants in Glenwood Springs, skiing groomers throughout the Roaring Fork Valley during winter or, when it’s nice, hiking all over Colorado high country.So, when Hanging Lake has a permanent trail connecting to it hopefully within the next three years, Werner can perhaps enjoy the fruits of her labor.“I really couldn’t ask for more,” she said. “I have a blast.”",27.06.2022,,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/meet-one-of-the-many-people-behind-hanging-lakes-reopening/

The proposed  is no different. Everything about the venture is large-scale, from its nationwide scope to potential global impacts. Although the UBR, at 88 miles, is considered a “short line,” it would create a new link in the oil supply chain connecting the vast, fracked-oil fields in northeast Utah’s Uinta Basin to the national rail network, passing through Glenwood Canyon on its way to the refineries on the Gulf Coast. The UBR, approved by the Federal Surface Transportation Board in late 2021, would provide enough transportation capacity to increase oil production in the Uinta Basin from between 80,000 and 90,000 barrels per day currently to 350,000 B/D — essentially quadrupling output. The increase in CO2 from expanding Uinta Basin production would come at a time when scientists around the world are sounding an alarm. In  the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated that global greenhouse gas emissions must peak by 2025, drop by half by 2030 with net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050 to avoid catastrophic and possibly irreversible climate changes. Combined CO2 emissions from the estimated  operations in the Uinta Basin as a result of the UBR and  range from about 20 to 55 megatons per year, which, at the high end, is equal to about  CO2 output in 2020. The type of oil found in the Uinta Basin is tricky to transport and difficult to refine. Called “waxy crude” because of its high paraffin content, it solidifies at about 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The  states that it must be “heated in the field and transported in insulated trucks.” As explained by Adam Sayres, president of Axia Energy II, which operates in the Uinta Basin, Uinta crude is like . He gave a detailed  to the Board of Trustees of Utah’s School & Institutional Trust Lands Administration in May 2018, stating that the crude is liquid underground at about 225 degrees, but once it hits the surface, it has to be kept in heated tanks at 180 degrees. Then, it’s loaded onto insulated trucks that head for Salt Lake City refineries, about 150 miles away. According to Matt Sands, host of the Mineral Rights Podcast, in 2019, those refineries had a total production capacity for for Uinta Basin waxy crude. Salt Lake City was declared a nonattainment area by the Environmental Protection Agency for air-quality standards twice in one decade — in 2009 for fine particulate matter and in 2015 for ozone — which proved problematic for those wanting to increase Uinta Basin waxy-crude production. “Production has had to mirror the refining capacity,” Sayres  the board of Utah’s School & Institutional Trust Lands Administration. Bryce Bird, director of the Utah Division of Air Quality, told Aspen Journalism that ozone levels have not improved and emissions from all refining operations are capped due to air-quality concerns. “Without getting permit changes or offsetting emissions, the refineries cannot increase production,” he said. Wendy Park, an attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity, a conservation group opposed to the UBR, said Uinta Basin oil producers are locked into the Salt Lake City refinery market, which gives the refineries a distinct advantage. “The Salt Lake City refineries can ask for a discount because there isn’t much competition for this waxy crude oil, (since companies) can’t get it to other customers,” she said. “The increase in markets for Uinta Basin crude would allow oil producers to charge higher prices, which would spur increased drilling.”The only way to increase production in the Uinta Basin is to refine the waxy crude somewhere else. Proponents of the UBR say the best way to do that is to link the Uinta Basin by rail to the national rail network, near Price, Utah, and take that crude to Gulf Coast refineries that can handle it.The UBR promises to add from three to 10 oil trains daily to the national railway running through Colorado. The trains would share the tracks with Amtrak and freight haulers, winding through Glenwood Canyon and up through the Moffat Tunnel before descending to Denver and then east and south. The waxy crude would be shipped in heated unit cars — approximately 110 cars per train with the  to carry about 642 barrels in each car.Communities along the Colorado route, including the city of Glenwood Springs, have  Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper against the UBR, citing concerns about air quality, wildlife, water and public safety. Glenwood Springs Mayor Jonathan Godes told Aspen Journalism that an accident or spill in Glenwood Canyon would be disastrous all the way to the Sea of Cortez. “To say it’s a far-fetched possibility, I think, is to ignore reality,” he said. “If that waxy crude that’s heated in order to stay viscous spills into our watershed and into the Colorado River, it would be a massive cleanup where they would have to remove tons of soil and debris.” Eagle County officials, who are party to a lawsuit challenging the Federal Surface Transportation Board’s December approval of the UBR, have also voiced concerns that the as an alternate route for the oil trains should the national rail network through Colorado — particularly the Moffat Tunnel — become crowded.Texas-based Rio Grande Pacific Corp, which plans to build and operate the UBR, also owns Colorado, Midland & Pacific Railway, which, in late 2020, attempted to of the Tennessee Pass line from Union Pacific for possible commuter/passenger service and freight options, and applied for fast-track approval from the Federal Surface Transportation Board. Rio Grande Pacific Corp made a point of that it “has no plan to operate oil trains over Tennessee Pass.” Rio Grande Pacific Corp even went so far as to amend its plan a week before the Federal Surface Transportation Board made its decision, requesting restrictions on hauling crude oil, coal and hazardous materials in the proposed lease. But Eagle County Commissioner Matt Scherr is not convinced. “There is no way they can commit to that,” he told Aspen Journalism. “They are not allowed to officially make a promise that [they] will not do some sort of activity on a line that has a general practice of moving freight.”The Federal Surface Transportation Board  — and, by extension, Rio Grande Pacific Corp’s proposed amendment — on March 25, 2021, for a variety of reasons, including public opposition and Rio Grande Pacific Corp’s apparent rush to get it done. But the decision left the door open for Colorado, Midland & Pacific Railway to reapply with a more comprehensive impact review and a full application process. “So, the proposal could come back,” said Park.The Seven County Infrastructure Coalition, which spearheaded this iteration of the UBR, was created in 2014, initially with only six rural eastern Utah counties — Uintah, Duchesne, Carbon, Daggett, Emery and San Juan counties. The coalition’s mission, according to its , is to allow “members to build essential regional infrastructure elements that span across county lines” for the economic benefit of the area. In 2017, the coalition expanded to include Sevier County. According to a timeline provided in a  issued in a pending lawsuit, the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition  for a $30 million grant for the UBR project from Utah’s Permanent Community Impact Fund Board on Feb. 1, 2018. The board oversees the Utah Permanent Community Impact Fund, which holds federal mineral lease money allocated to the state from oil and natural gas royalties. Those funds are mandated by state and  to go to counties and municipalities on the front lines of mineral extraction, and the operable federal statute  state legislatures to direct funds toward the “planning, construction and maintenance of public facilities, and provision of public service.”Typically, those communities are rural, and many depend on federal mineral lease money to weather the boom-and-bust cycles of the industry. “During a boom, they need more police, hospitals, emergency services, schools, and teachers,” Park said. “And after the workers leave, communities experience a dip in their tax revenue. So this is a way to help them.”The Seven County Infrastructure Coalition wanted the money to “complete preconstruction design and permitting for a rail line from northeastern Utah into northwestern Colorado” that would connect the UBR to the national rail network. (An early proposal for the UBR had tracks running east toward Craig, Colorado.) The Permanent Community Impact Fund Board rejected the application because it was incomplete and did not include an . The Seven County Infrastructure Coalition submitted  for $27.9 million on Sept. 13, 2018. At a Seven County Infrastructure Coalition meeting on Oct. 11, 2018, the group’s lawyer  the railroad was, based on two feasibility studies, “viable but not at the rate of return that would entice private industry” and recommended that it be funded by a “public body”. The Permanent Community Impact Fund Board did not grant the full $27 million, however, due to questions from the Utah attorney general’s office regarding the legality of using Permanent Community Impact Fund Board funds for the railway. An exchange between the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition’s attorney and then-Assistant Attorney General Alison Garner began with an  from Garner, questioning how the railway project would fit with federal and state laws governing the use of public funds. Those  “whether the proposed project is truly a public project as defined under federal and state law, whether expending restricted mineral lease funds outside of Utah is consistent with federal and state law, and whether the proposed project constitutes improper economic development.” , dated Oct. 23, 2018, the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition argued that the law grants local jurisdictions wide latitude in determining how to best invest mineral lease funds, and that the UBR application met applicable criteria. “Through the [Seven County Infrastructure Coalition], local Utah officials have selected rail as the best solution, and the political preferences of California environmentalists should not be allowed to prevail,”  the letter, which asked the attorney general’s office to withdraw its letter and “invited” officials instead to write another letter in support of the Permanent Community Impact Fund Board application.Garner  a week later with similar concerns, including the legality of using public funds for “mere economic development.” She specifically  part of the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition’s application that stated “the ultimate goal of the [Uinta Rail Line] is to provide prospective Uinta Basin rail shippers with the lowest cost transportation option between the Uinta Basin and national markets” and “the winners would be the producers, royalty recipients … and taxing authorities.”At a Nov. 8, 2018, Permanent Community Impact Fund Board meeting, the AG’s office , prompting the fund’s board to grant only $6.5 million for “engineering and other technical studies.” Then, between November 2018 and June 2019, the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition chose Drexel Hamilton Infrastructure Partners, now known as the DHIP Group, an asset management firm, for a “public-private partnership to finance and develop the railway.” The DHIP Group signed a memorandum of understanding with Texas-based Rio Grande Pacific Corporation to “operate and maintain” the UBR. In June 2019, the Permanent Community Impact Fund Board approved the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition’s application for the remaining $21.4 million for  of the project  from a Permanent Community Impact Fund Board member about “the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition’s rush to fund and complete the project given its size and complexity, the lack of a robust procurement process to ensure the project‘s success, the speculative nature of the return on investment, and the potentially risky use of public funds,” as described in the judge’s order.In August 2020, the Center for Biological Diversity and Living Rivers  in Utah’s 3rd District Court in Salt Lake County, against the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition, the Permanent Community Impact Fund Board, and the Utah Department of Workforce Services’ Housing and Community Development Division for possible illegal misuse of public funds. Park represents the plaintiffs. “Our claim is that it violated the state legislature’s and Congress’ intent for those funds to be used to  of mineral development in communities that have mining and drilling on public lands,” she said. “Instead, the funds are being used to promote and increase fossil fuel development with the goal of building the Uinta Basin Railroad.” In early December 2020, Uintah County, Duchesne County and the Uintah Transportation Special Service District filed motions to intervene on behalf of the defendants. Officials representing these jurisdictions oppose the suit on the argument that the railway falls under their responsibilities for the safety and welfare of their citizens. The counties have stated that oil production will increase in the basin with or without the railroad, and argue that moving oil by train is safer and cleaner than using tanker trucks.Uintah County was defiant,  that it is the county’s responsibility — not the petitioners’ — to determine whether the UBR is an appropriate way to spend mineral lease funds. The Uintah Transportation Special Service District, almost entirely dependent on Permanent Community Impact Fund Board funds, accused the petitioners of false concerns for oil-and-gas-impacted communities. The Uintah Transportation Special Service District  that the environmental groups suing to block the use of Permanent Community Impact Fund Board funds exist primarily to stop extraction of oil and gas. The“intent and purpose” of the litigation, the Uintah Transportation Special Service District argues, is to “deprive local communities of the very resources needed to provide vital services to residents.” By the time of a hearing in the case last August, a representative of the Utah’s attorney general’s office provided a more favorable assessment of the UBR funding’s legal prospects. According to a Salt Lake Tribune  on the hearing, Assistant Attorney General Daniel Widdison said that investing in the UBR aligns with the Mineral Leasing Act by making oil extraction safer and helping other area industries. “If this project can get trucks off the road, if it can create a higher viability or sustainability for other industries in the area or, frankly, if it can make extraction of the oil safer, any of those would constitute alleviation of mineral extraction,” Widdison said, according to the Tribune. “Recognizing … that mineral extraction is an inevitability.”By the time the suit was filed, the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition  about $12.5 million on “preconstruction planning,” according to the judge’s timeline. By January 2021, total spending of the Permanent Community Impact Fund Board funds reached about $21 million. Prior to March 2021, Utah law regarding use of Permanent Community Impact Fund Board funds required that the money go to front-line communities in need and included multiple provisions stating that the funds be used to alleviate the impacts of resource development. But between the time the suit was filed and the initial evidentiary hearing, state legislators .2021’s Senate Bill 176, titled Mineral Lease Fund Amendments,  language stating that the funds shall be used “for the alleviation of social, economic and public finance impacts resulting from the development of natural resources in this state” with “planning, construction and maintenance of public facilities, and provision of public service.” Lawmakers also added a subsection, defining the word and intention of  to include studies, analyses, plans and surveys among other changes.The amendment applies  and includes the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition’s grant application. The plaintiffs have accused the respondents of “.” In September, 3rd District Court Judge Adam Mow ruled against the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment,  that sufficient evidence had been presented to establish “a genuine issue of material fact” as to whether the railway would mitigate the burden on local communities caused by resource extraction. Mow also ruled for more discovery, pertaining to one of the plaintiffs’ concerns having to do with what the impacts would be if the UBR was allowed to continue. Park puts it this way: “Essentially, the court said there was little evidence showing what harms would result from funding the railway, so it ordered that discovery continue on that issue,” she said. “But, by that time, discovery was already closed, so there was no real opportunity to develop evidence on that point.”The occurred May 25. Park said if the judge rules in favor of the plaintiffs, remedies include returning the money to the Utah Permanent Community Impact Fund. The judge plans to have a decision by late July.The Seven County Infrastructure Coalition filed a petition for UBR approval from the Federal Surface Transportation Board in May 2020, and the Permanent Community Impact Fund Board funds paid for ICF, an environmental consulting firm, to write the environmental impact statement upon which the Federal Surface Transportation Board relied to make its decision. The Federal Surface Transportation Board  to the UBR in December. Federal Surface Transportation Board Board Chair Martin Oberman cast the sole , stating that the “environmental impacts outweigh the transportation merits.” Oberman’s lengthy opinion questions the board’s evaluation of the downstream impacts and the overall contribution to climate change. He also cited the financial viability of the UBR given volatile oil prices and the shifting fossil fuel industry.The same conservation groups that sued in Utah district court filed a second  on Feb. 11, 2022, in federal court in Washington, D.C., challenging the Federal Surface Transportation Board’s environmental review and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s biological assessment.Eagle County had already filed suit against the Federal Surface Transportation Board on Feb. 10, asking the court to vacate the decision. The county stated that, among other reasons, the decision “” and violated .Nathanial Hunt, outside counsel for Eagle County, told Aspen Journalism in an email that the board “failed to adequately review the environmental impacts of the project, failed to adequately determine whether the project is needed, financially viable, and in the public interest.” The court combined the cases, due to similarities, on Feb. 14. Park told Aspen Journalism in an email that the case is in its early stages. “We are now reviewing the administrative record and the parties will propose a briefing schedule to the court toward the end of [June],” she said. The proposed cost of the  for the UBR is  for 88 miles of track. The DHIP Group, as part of the public-private partnership including Seven County Infrastructure Coalition and Rio Grande Pacific Corporation, has agreed to finance the project with a $1.5 billion commitment. Construction of the rail line also hinges on commitments from shippers and refineries before it can move forward, and those commitments depend on increased production at a time when the ability to transport significant amounts of the basin’s waxy crude to markets outside Salt Lake City is limited. Mark Hemphill, senior vice president of Rio Grande Pacific Corporation, told  in October 2019, that the UBR needs customers. “A billion-and-a-half-dollar railroad cannot be built on an ‘If you build it, they will come’ basis,” he said. (Hemphill did not respond to Aspen Journalism’s requests for comment.)But refineries are reluctant to climb aboard the UBR until there is more oil coming out of the basin. Jim Finley of Finley Resources, the largest crude oil producer in the basin at 28,000 B/D, told the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition at its Oct. 22 meeting that it’s a catch-22. “In order to increase the volume, we have to have transportation, and in order to have improved transportation, we have to have the volume,” Finley said, according to the meeting’s .It is difficult to say whether railroad proponents have secured the necessary commitments; Finley did not respond to Aspen Journalism’s requests for comment. In fact, he failed to show up for two scheduled telephone interviews. DHIP Group representatives also did not respond to requests for comment. Tom Shaw, a Houston-based independent energy consultant, told Aspen Journalism that the UBR and similar projects are caught between the high price of oil and the urgent need to reduce fossil fuel extraction and use due to climate change. “That’s the whole issue with oil and gas right now,” he said. “Oil prices are at a historic level, but there is very little investment in the sector because of climate change.” That means higher prices at the pump. “If you can’t drill for it, you can’t produce it,” he said. “And if you can’t produce it, you can’t sell it.” In order to proceed, UBR still needs final authorization from Utah’s Ashley National Forest for the 12 miles of tracks that would run through an inventoried roadless area. Those tracks would closely follow U.S. Highway 191, but approving the railroad through the roadless area could prompt an additional legal challenge.

Colorado officials looking for engagement on updated water plan,"['https://cdn.aspentimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/07/water-atd-070422-1024x685.jpg', 'https://cdn.aspentimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/07/water-atd-070422-2-1-1024x681.jpg', 'https://cdn.vaildaily.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/07/Raymond-Langstaff-1024x768.jpeg', 'https://cdn.aspentimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/07/water-atd-070422-3-1-1024x765.jpg']","State officials are hoping dire climate predictions and water shortages will convince Coloradans to get involved in planning how to share a dwindling resource. Colorado Water Conservation Board staff released the second iteration of the Colorado Water Plan on Thursday, which is now . The first version of the plan was implemented in 2015. Words from the late water expert and former Colorado Supreme Court Justice Greg Hobbs set the tone on page 1 of the document: The 21st century is no longer about developing a resource, it is now an era of limits and learning how to share a developed resource.“I think we get to educate and engage and inspire and be an example, and I think that’s the benefit,” said CWCB Executive Director Becky Mitchell. “I think when we are given the opportunity to lead, Coloradans do that.” The updated plan lays out four interconnected areas for action: vibrant communities, robust agriculture, thriving watersheds and resilient planning. Although municipal and industry does not currently experience a gap, the plan predicts a 240,000- to 740,000-acre-foot shortfall for cities and industries by 2050. According to the plan, about 20% of agriculture diversion demand is currently not met statewide, and that gap could grow to a 3.5 million-acre-foot shortfall by 2050 under the “hot growth” scenario that would see temperatures rise 4.2 degrees Fahrenheit.Meeting these supply-demand gaps will require hundreds of water projects throughout Colorado’s eight river basins, and carries a price tag of $20 billion. These projects, many of which have benefits to more than one water-use sector, are laid out in each roundtable’s Basin Implementation Plan. The 239-page document is set against the backdrop of climate change, which plays a bigger role in this water plan than in the 2015 version. The first water plan did not include projections of future climate change in its analyses. Three of the five planning scenarios now include assumptions of hotter conditions in the years to come. According to the plan, Colorado has had three of the top five driest years on record since 2000 and has experienced a 2-degree Fahrenheit increase in average temperature. The state may see an additional 2.5 to 5 degrees warming by 2050. Most projections show a decline in spring snowpack and more frequent heat waves, drought and wildfire, all of which have implications for water.Environmental and recreation water needs could see the worst impacts since those uses generally have the most junior water rights. “Peak runoff may shift as much as one month earlier, which could lead to drier conditions in summer months and impact storage, irrigation and streamflow,” the plan reads. “Decreased peak flows across the basin create risks for riparian/wetland plants and fish habitat. Instream flows and recreational in-channel diversions may not be met if June-August flows decrease due to climate change.”The new plan addressed a tension from the first plan: Front Range water providers would like the ability to develop new transmountain diversions in the future, while Western Slope stakeholders say not to look to the Colorado River basin for more water for thirsty cities. Colorado’s Front Range currently takes about 500,000 acre-feet of water a year from the headwaters of the Colorado River basin across the Continental Divide. The plan stopped short of a detailed analysis of transmountain diversions because of ongoing litigation and permitting processes but promised that state staff would facilitate discussions about transmountain diversions before the next update to the plan. “Our promise to West Slope folks was when we could get past those legal barriers, we would take an honest look at trying to have a better conversation,” said Russ Sands, senior program manager for the CWCB’s water supply planning section. “I think we owe it to our stakeholders to try and focus on analysis.”The plan says Colorado will continue the slow but steady transformation of moving water from agriculture — by far the largest water user — to cities, with nearly 14,000 acres of irrigated land expected to be urbanized, one-third of that in the Grand Valley. Stakeholders estimate the loss of irrigated land to “buy-and-dry” to be even greater at 33,000 to 76,000 acres, which is three times higher than the 2015 Water Plan estimate. But this could be eased by innovative and flexible agreements between water users that allow the temporary transfer of water from one use to another. Formerly known as Alternative Transfer Methods, state officials have rebranded them Collaborative Water Sharing Agreements, which allow water sharing, but prevent the permanent removal of water from the land. State officials have also made an effort to be more inclusive this time around and in March 2021 convened a Water Equity Task Force to help shape a guiding set of principles around equity, diversity and inclusion to inform the water plan. Abby Burk, the western rivers regional program manager with Audubon Rockies, was an equity task force member. “People are engaging and leaning into the space other than just the water-right owners,” she said. “We are all supported by water every single day. How do we expand this decision-making to include more voices? How do we open our arms and encourage more people to come into this space?”The 2015 Water Plan racked up more than 30,000 comments, and state officials are hoping Coloradans become even more involved this time around. The plan lays out three levels of engagement citizens can take and encourages Coloradans to promote water conservation, join water-focused stakeholder groups and coordinate with local leaders to advance water policy. And there is a small bright spot that shows the potential for change when citizens get engaged: The plan says that Coloradans have reduced their per-person water use from 172 to 164 gallons a day, a 5% reduction in demand since 2008, mainly due to conservation efforts.Sands said the tough conditions can open people’s minds and make them more willing to come to the table to talk.“I think we are actually going to see more collaboration than ever,” he said. The update to the Colorado Water Plan is open for public comment until Sept. 30, and CWCB staff will also hold four online listening sessions. The plan is scheduled to be finalized by the CWCB in January 2023. ",04.07.2022,,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/colorado-officials-looking-for-engagement-on-updated-water-plan/
Colorado River Fire Rescue Chief Leif Sackett works to keep the community safe from fire,['https://cdn.aspentimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/07/firechief-atd-070522-1024x676.jpg'],"Wednesday was an easier-than-some day extinguishing threats for Leif Sackett. Just a few small, potentially volatile brush fires on U.S. Highway 6 for the Colorado River Fire Rescue chief.“We’ve had multiple of those kinds of fires this year already,” he said. “Whether it be a dragging chain or a cigarette thrown out, usually those spot fires are hard to pinpoint.”Sackett sat in his office at Station 41 along Railroad Avenue in Rifle. It’s decorated in firefighter memorabilia, family photos and cooled by good air conditioning. Temperatures on summer days are usually a lot hotter outside Sackett’s office, serving as a constant reminder of the season’s greatest threat.Wildland fires poses the No. 1 risk to Rifle, Silt and New Castle when the season changes, Sackett said, and CRFR is responsible for covering an 851-square-mile stretch.Sackett remembers one vividly: a 2008 wildland fire that threatened structures consumed up to 30 acres to a smoldering crisp near Highway 13 north of Rifle. No one was hurt, but the situation could have easily turned out differently.“The wind was blowing one way, and we were out fighting it, and the wind switched direction and blew the smoke back on us to where you couldn’t see where you were at,” Sackett reminisced. “It blew back on us for only a minute or two, but it was enough to where you had to cover your eyes, cover your mouth, because you couldn’t breathe, you couldn’t see.”This year, the city of Rifle scheduled igniting live fireworks above Centennial Park. It’s the only live fireworks display in all of Garfield County for Independence Day celebrations, and should hopefully satisfy those looking for an aerial explosion or two over the holiday weekend.“I hope people leave shooting fireworks to the professionals,” Sackett said, his arms folding on his desk. “To me, it’s all about the safety of the community.”One could argue Sackett, 44, was exclusively put on this earth to be a firefighter. Both his grandfathers were volunteer firefighters. His father, Steve, was a volunteer firefighter.Sackett is originally from Cope, Colorado, an unincorporated town less than 50 miles west of the Kansas border. Like many kids growing up in rural communities, he said he started driving around age 11. He also helped in his father’s chemical and fertilizer business.Like grandfather, like father, like son: By the time Sackett graduated from Arickaree High School (class size 13) and went on to play college football at Sterling College in Kansas, he would come back home intermittently to volunteer at the local fire department. That was 1999.“I can’t say there’s something that I have or haven’t done,” Sackett said of his career. “Each experience is a little different. But an accident out on the Eastern Plains is not much different than an accident here in western Colorado.”In 2001, just after Sackett graduated college with a degree in business administration, he met his wife, Celena. In fact, they just celebrated their 20th anniversary in December.By 2005, Sackett’s father had sold his fertilizer business, which prompted Sackett to enroll in a residency program offered by the Eagle River Fire Protection District in Eagle County. After he finished, Sackett was hired as a firefighter/EMT for the Colorado River Fire District in February 2006.“Celena stayed home in Eastern Colorado for 18 months while I went through academy and got hired on here in Rifle,” Sackett said. “I don’t know many women who would put up with a husband being gone for that long and not helping with three young kids. She is an amazing woman.”Sackett now lives in the Parachute/Battlement Mesa area. Celena and he have three kids: Ryley, 20, Kade, 17, and Kyson, 16.He helps coach track and field and announces during athletics events for Grand Valley High School. He also admits to playing a lot of golf.There’s a running joke aimed at any CRFR firefighter who can’t grow an impressive handlebar mustache. If the setup is shoddy, it’s considered “dirty,” Sackett said.“That’s what it looks like,” he said mischievously. “It looks like dirt on their lip.”In addition to razzing, CRFR firefighters have contests each year for unofficial holidays like March Mustache Madness or No Shave November to see who can grow the dirtiest mustache. The nastier the facial hair, the greater the chances of winning. Sackett himself sports quite a formidable handlebar mustache. PJ Tillman is a CRFR administrative director of six years, and she knows all too well how challenging it can be for Sackett to maintain.“When he goes to lunch, he’ll get stuff in his mustache,” she said.Occasional crumbs aside, Sackett’s dedication to CRFR is spotless.“He is very driven and compassionate,” Tillman said. “He just gets things done and cares about everyone that works here in our community.”Sackett started growing a mustache when he started climbing the ladder. He became CRFR lieutenant in 2009 and later battalion chief in 2013 and operations chief in 2016. During this time, Sackett was under the tutelage of longtime CRFR Fire Chief Randy Callahan.“Everyone has a few people in their lives that have made a difference in getting them to where they are today,” Sackett said. “My dad and Chief Callahan are two of those people.”Sackett’s father taught him patience, leadership and too many life lessons to list, he said. Callahan broadened his horizons and opened his mind to leadership principles.Callahan is a lifelong learner of leadership and how it plays into organizational development, Sackett said.“He introduced me to the concept of courage and vulnerability being the biggest values all people in a position of leadership need,” he said. “He taught me how you can’t be in a position of trust/leadership without having the courage to know you don’t have all the answers yet being vulnerable enough to tell people you don’t have all the answers.”Facing a budget crisis spurred by a dropping market in oil and gas revenues, Callahan volunteered to retire early in 2020. The same crisis meant CRFR sold off apparatus and closed down one of its stations.“You’re taking safety away from the community when you do that,” Sackett said. “You’re taking livelihoods away from people if you have to do that.”In 2020, the hum of bagpipe music serenaded Station 41 as CRFR held its first ever change of command ceremony. Callahan, a firefighter of nearly half a century, officially hung up the helmet, and Sackett became chief.It’s a moment that continues to fuel Sackett.“The biggest satisfaction I get from doing my job is seeing our crew smile and have a good time when they’re in the station,” Sackett said. “That translates to them providing a great service. They’re mission focused, they’re values driven.”“That translates to a community that is safer as well as a community that trusts us.”",05.07.2022,Ray Erku,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/crfr-chief-leif-sackett-works-to-keep-the-community-safe-from-fire-during-summer-season/
"How one man’s dream benefited 25,000 Western Slope students","['https://cdn.aspentimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/07/PXL_20220622_210110667.PORTRAIT-768x1024-1.jpg', 'https://cdn.aspentimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/07/cmc-atd-070622-2-768x1024.jpg']","David Delaplane pondered a crucial question in his tiny Glenwood Springs cabin.How could the local chamber of commerce that he managed improve education in the area? His answer was to start a college — an ambitious goal for a chamber that hadn’t recorded any education work.Delaplane said he contacted the chamber’s education committee and “they said, ‘Well, yeah, let’s go for it.’” Today, Delaplane’s idea lives on as Colorado Mountain College and has shaped the lives of over 25,000 graduates since the school was founded in 1965. Delaplane, 94, never imagined his creation would expand across the Western Slope and eventually offer bachelor’s degrees. He sees it as one of the great college success stories, growing from two campuses to 11, covering over 12,000 square miles.Delaplane recently reflected on . Here’s what he had to say.While managing the chamber, Delaplane also served as a pastor. His path to become a pastor included education at three colleges. Higher education has been an issue he cared about deeply.At the time, Glenwood Springs and other mountain towns weren’t the resort towns they are today. There was no ski industry, and Interstate 70 wasn’t finished. The gateway to mountain towns ran through Loveland Pass, a long journey to Denver and the Front Range.Residents had few nearby, convenient college options.Delaplane wanted to , especially the kids of ranchers and farmers, to get an education.“I wanted to try to at least get something started where young people could at a reasonable cost go to college closer,” he said.To start a school, Delaplane and the chamber needed to petition the Colorado Department of Education and State Board of Education for approval. They received unanimous support. Delaplane still has the letter from Aug. 13, 1965, allowing the chamber to go ahead with its idea.Delaplane and the committee toured the five surrounding counties to ask voters to tax themselves to create a school and use the money to fund its operations. Four of the five counties voted for the measure, ensuring the school’s foundation. Delaplane and local leaders didn’t have a road map for establishing a college. The president of what is now Colorado Mesa University offered advice: First, he said, hire a president.Delaplane and the board landed a president from Michigan. But the succeeding years of the school were marked by tragedy. The school’s first and second school presidents died in plane crashes.Early college courses included commercial art, English, data processing, welding, and agriculture. In 1971, as ski areas grew and multiplied, the Leadville campus began a one-year certificate in ski area operations. A school spokeswoman said it reportedly was the only program of its kind in the country.The school now offers two- and four-year degrees, including jobs that connect students with the health care and the ski industries. The school also houses students, in an area where finding affordable housing is difficult.Earlier this year, state lawmakers pointed out . The school develops many of its programs in partnership with business leaders.That’s always been the relationship the school has with the community, said Angie Anderson, Glenwood Springs Chamber Resort Association CEO and president.The local tax carries on and is unusual among higher education institutions that receive the majority of their funds from the state. Instead, Colorado Mountain College receives the majority of its funding from its local tax base. Anderson believes that the use of local dollars makes Colorado Mountain College leaders more responsive to the community because the school must continually show it’s a worthwhile investment. And the special tax is used by the school to keep tuition low for students who live in the area.“They work really, really hard to ensure that they’re serving the communities that are basically funding them,” Anderson said.Delaplane often wears a Colorado Mountain College hat, which he said helps strike up conversation with former students. Most recently, he found out a nurse at his doctor’s office graduated from the college, a training program he never originally envisioned in his cabin.“It’s just wonderful to know that you’re meeting people who tell me that they got their start at Colorado Mountain College,” he said.Read .",06.07.2022,,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/how-one-mans-dream-benefited-25000-western-slope-students/
What’s worth saving at Sweetwater Lake?,"['https://cdn.aspentimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/07/Cvrsweetwater-VDN-0706722-1024x683-1.jpeg', 'https://cdn.aspentimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/07/sweetwater-VDN-0706722-1-1024x683-1.jpeg', 'https://cdn.aspentimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/07/sweetwater-VDN-0706722-4-1024x683-1.jpeg']","White River National Forest Supervisor Scott Fitzwilliams addressed the Gypsum Town Council last week amid growing concerns over the impact of the Sweetwater Lake public land acquisition and transition from private property into a state park.The White River National Forest  last August after a  led by the Eagle Valley Land Trust to purchase the property as a protection against future land development. The lake is located in remote northeastern Garfield County, but is accessed from Eagle County, and Eagle County was instrumental in making the purchase happen. The county donated ​​$500,000 to the Save the Lake campaign, and the town of Gypsum gave $100,000.While the public acquisition of the land was a success for the campaign, , particularly concerning overcrowding, the treatment of existing buildings, and the impact on one woman’s decades-long business on the property.There are a number of existing buildings on the land, including cabins and a lodge that have been a part of the landscape for generations. Fitzwilliams said that a recent engineering analysis of the structures found them all to be unsafe for human occupation. The plan was to destroy the structures, but this has generated strong opposition from local residents.“I’m baffled, I’m confused and I feel bad about this miscommunication, misunderstanding, that saving Sweetwater Lake was about saving those buildings,” Fitzwilliams said in a presentation to the Gypsum Town Council. “My first comment to the conservation was, I don’t want them with the buildings. If you get rid of the buildings, we’ll talk, because that’s not what Land and Water Conservation funding is for.”Members of the Town Council were quick to defend the value of the buildings, and the importance of preserving them for the local community.“I think you’ve kind of missed the point that saving the Sweetwater Lake was about saving the heritage of that community, and part and parcel of what is in that community is some buildings,” said Council member Bill Baxter. “Some of which are very important to the heritage, to folks that have been here forever, such as myself, that can remember being 5 years old and going up there and spending time.”Council member Tom Edwards, who is also a board member of the Eagle Valley Land Trust, expressed a vision for preservation.“It’s really the character of what’s up there that we’re trying to preserve, and that might be done, in my mind at least, with some combination of the old buildings that can be salvaged, and if we have to in some cases, new buildings that provide the things that you’re saying,” Edwards said.The nearly 40-year local business of Adrienne Brink, AJ Brink Outfitters, is another point of contention. Brink requires the buildings to run her business but does not own them. While protecting one person’s private business does not rank high for the U.S. Forest Service in this project, the council again made it clear that Brink’s business is part of the fabric of the community.“It’s really hard to think about that chicken fried steak not being up there, or that piece of pie that is the best, or that trout that’s like the best trout I’ve ever had in my life that Adrienne throws out,” said Council member Kathleen Brendza. “I think that’s the uniqueness of it. It’s about that personality that is so endearing to us all.”Fitzwilliams grew visibly exasperated as the conversation went on. He said that the National Forest has now purchased the buildings in order to accommodate Brink, and he has taken on considerable personal risk in allowing people to occupy the buildings, but there is only so much Forest Services officials are willing to do and spend to support a private business.“I’ve got to justify the expense of taxpayers’ dollars,” Fitzwilliams said. “We purchased this not just for the small Sweetwater community — it’s now owned by every American in the country. So we have to approach this as how is this in the greatest good over the long run.”The dissonance between local values and state and federal priorities was clearly demonstrated in the Town Council meeting, which is why the next step is a collaborative master planning process with communities and stakeholders to make sure everyone’s priorities are taken into account when designing the new national park.Overcrowding is a substantial concern, having seen how similar destinations like Hanging Lake have fared, but Fitzwilliams emphasized that the ability to strategically plan the park is a powerful tool that will determine the future of Sweetwater Lake.“No matter what, it’s going to attract people. A lot of them,” Fitzwilliams said. “It’s easy to get to, it’s a really good road and it’s a beautiful place, and it’s now public land … here we have an opportunity to start from scratch. How big a parking lot do you want for day use? If you have a parking lot that holds X amount of cars and it’s full, that’s what your day use is going to be … you control the numbers through that infrastructure, and that’s an opportunity we have in this scenario.”Fitzwilliams said that a design team will be holding collaborative planning sessions over the next three months, at which point he will return to the Gypsum Town Council and other local government entities to present a master plan.“I think if we give it three months, working with folks in the community and other people that are interested and the state, then if we’re off base, I don’t know what plan B is but we’ll think of something else,” Fitzwilliams said.",07.07.2022,,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/whats-worth-saving-at-sweetwater-lake/
Recent drop in Lake Powell’s storage shows how much space sediment is taking up,"['https://cdn.aspentimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/07/ajpowell-atd-07XX22-1024x683.jpg', 'https://cdn.aspentimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/07/ajpowell-atd-07xx22-2-1024x386.jpg']","The Bureau of Reclamation last week revised its data on the amount of water stored in Lake Powell, with a new, lower tally taking into account a 4% drop in the reservoir’s total available capacity between 1986 and 2018 due to sedimentation.Bureau data on the reservoir’s water-storage volume showed a loss of 443,000 acre-feet between June 30 and July 1 — a 6% drop in storage from 6.87 million acre-feet (which is 28.28% of live storage based on 1986 data) to 6.43 million (26.46% of full).  The cause was a recalculation of water stored based on a Bureau of Reclamation and U.S.Geological Survey  released in March — the first such analysis in more than 30 years — about Lake Powell’s loss of storage capacity due to the amount of sediment that the Colorado River and other tributaries deposit into the reservoir. The study was based on data about sediment in the lake collected in 2017 and 2018.“After inputting the new data on July 1, 2022, storage values at the current elevation were updated, resulting in a decrease of 443,000 acre-feet,” bureau officials wrote in an email. The Bureau of Reclamation has performed two prior sediment surveys: pre-impoundment (before the construction of the dam — up to 1963) and in 1986. Storage capacity figures prior to the release of the report in March had been based on 1986 data, Casey Root, a hydrologist for the U.S. Geological Survey’s Utah Water Science Center, said in an email.The new data will be included in the upcoming July 24-Month Study, scheduled to be released in mid-July, which forecasts the reservoir’s volume and surface elevation, and in any subsequent operational projections.“Like most reservoirs, Lake Powell loses storage capacity as a result of sedimentation from its source rivers,” said Root, who worked on the most recent USGS and Bureau of Reclamation study.The paper  that Lake Powell has continuously trapped sediment — including silt, sand and mud — from the Colorado and San Juan rivers since the Glen Canyon Dam impounded the rivers in 1963. The meeting of the free-flowing rivers carrying sediment with the slack water of the reservoir creates a delta, where the sediment falls to the lake’s bottom.Root explained that the delta regions are located at the furthest extents of Lake Powell and that these areas typically contain the most sediment.“Sediment isn’t deposited uniformly across the reservoir but rather far from the dam,” he said. “Over time, these deposits can laterally build toward the dam.”Since it began filling in 1963, the reservoir has lost on average about 33,270 acre-feet in storage capacity each year,  to the study.  “Lake Powell is unique in that it is a long, narrow, steep-walled canyon, so the deltas have historically been about 150 miles away from Glen Canyon Dam,” Root said. “Simply being far away from the deltas can help buffer the dam and its operations against sedimentation.”Due to this sedimentation, Lake Powell’s storage capacity at full pool  by 6.79% from 1963 to 2018, or a 1.83 million acre-foot loss.Between 1986 and 2018, it dropped by 4%, which represents a loss of 1.05 million acre-feet in 32 years.",09.07.2022,,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/recent-drop-in-lake-powells-storage-shows-how-much-space-sediment-is-taking-up/
"Crystal River rancher, Water Trust again try to boost flows","['https://cdn.aspentimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/07/Bill-Fales-1-1024x576.jpg', 'https://www.postindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/07/Helms-Ditch-headgate-1024x576.jpg', 'https://www.postindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/07/RFC-streamgauge-Thomas-Creek-bridge-1024x576.jpg', 'https://www.postindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/07/Bill-Fales-2-1024x576.jpg', 'https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=32757626-1ae5-5db1-a9ee-0dbedecb51ef&type=preview&width=500&height=500&q=60']","A Crystal River Valley rancher and a nonprofit organization are teaming up for the second time to try to leave more water in a parched stream.Cold Mountain Ranch owners Bill Fales and Marj Perry have inked a six-year deal with the Colorado Water Trust to voluntarily re-time their irrigation practices to leave water in the Crystal River during the late summer and early fall, when the river often needs it most. In addition to a $5,000 signing bonus, the ranchers will be paid $250 a day up to 20 days, for each cubic foot per second (cfs) they don’t divert, for a maximum payment of $30,000. The water would come from reducing diversions from the Helms Ditch and could result in up to an additional 6 cfs in the river. The agreement would become active in the months of August and September any time streamflows dip below 40 cfs and extend through October once it is active. The agreement will lift if streamflows rise above 55 cfs.The goal of the program is to use voluntary, market-based approaches to encourage agricultural water users — who often own the biggest and most senior water rights — to put water back into Colorado’s rivers during critical times. The program has the hallmarks of demand management, a much-discussed concept over the past few years at the state level: it’s temporary, voluntary and compensated. Other pilot programs that focus on agricultural water conservation usually involve full or split-season fallowing of fields, but with this agreement Fales still intends to get his usual two cuttings of hay.“The idea is to find something that is a flexible way for water rights owners to use their water in years where it makes sense for something different than strictly agricultural practices,” said Alyson Meyer-Gould, director of policy with the Colorado Water Trust. “It’s another way to use their water portfolio.”Streamflows will be measured by a gauge at the Thomas Road Bridge, which is operated by the Roaring Fork Conservancy. The Helms Ditch is located just upstream of the bridge. According to the Conservancy’s 2016 Crystal River Management Plan, the river below the Thomas Road Bridge often suffers from low flows and high temperatures, especially in drought years, due to the many agricultural diversions. The Crystal River also has a 1975 state instream flow right of 100 cfs on this stretch, intended to preserve the environment to a reasonable degree, but it is rarely met during the late irrigation season. Fales has often been a prominent spokesman for causes that combine agricultural and environmental interests, like preventing oil and gas development in the Thompson Divide area near Carbondale where he grazes cattle. “Obviously we are like everybody else — we hate to see the river dry,” Fales said. “Also Marj and I are fairly convinced that if there’s going to be problems and controversies over water, we’d rather be trying to find solutions ourselves than have one imposed on us by somebody else.” This is the second attempt at the voluntary non-diversion agreement. The timing and conditions during the original three-year agreement, signed in 2018, never worked out. That year saw flows that were so low that turning off the Helms Ditch would not have made a difference; 2019’s big snowpack meant flows never dipped low enough to trigger the agreement until October, which was not a month included in the original deal; and in the drought year of 2020 Cold Mountain Ranch could not spare any water. “Three years is not exactly a huge data sample, so we are still optimistic we can get the project to work,” Meyer Gould said. This time around, the Water Trust is offering Fales and Perry more money to encourage them to re-time the irrigation: $250 for each cfs, compared with $175 last time, plus the $5,000 signing bonus, when there was no such incentive attached to the 2018 agreement. “It’s considerable time and effort on their part,” Meyer Gould said. “We wanted to show appreciation for the thought and effort that has gone into it on the part of Cold Mountain Ranch.”Pitkin County also had to approve the agreement because it is the co-owner of a conservation easement on the property, which limits development, preserves open space and keeps the water rights tied to the land. During negotiations for the original agreement, Pitkin County Attorney John Ely voiced concerns about abandonment: If Fales produced the same amount of hay using less water than he historically had, could the unused portion of his water right be subject to Colorado’s “use-it-or-lose-it” principle? But Cold Mountain Ranch’s water rights are protected. Senate Bill 19, signed in 2013, provides abandonment protection if the water rights are enrolled in an approved conservation program, such as the agreement with the Water Trust. Also, instead of reducing his total annual water use like with most agriculture conservation programs, Fales will simply shift the timing of his diversions to align with the Crystal’s needs. Ely said his concerns have been worked out.“It’s not a classic situation where you have a dry-up of an ag property,” Ely said. “It really does protect his operations.”As demands for water increase across the Colorado River basin and climate change shrinks the amount available, Fales recognizes something’s got to give. And with agricultural users at the center of water issues, they should participate in finding creative solutions. “It’s not going to be simple,” Fales said. “But we would rather be at the table than on the plate.”",10.07.2022,,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/crystal-river-rancher-water-trust-again-try-to-boost-flows/

"Shooters Grill, owned by Rep. Boebert, closes its doors after losing its lease",['https://cdn.aspentimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/07/shooters-atd-071422-1024x687.jpg'],"For years, Downtown Rifle’s restaurant scene was furnished with one of the only places in the U.S. you could order a cheeseburger from a server packing a 9mm pistol on her hip. The establishment — Shooters Grill — was the brainchild of now-U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert.On Sunday, the Silt Republican officially closed the doors to her restaurant.“We were like a family,” she said. “I would say Shooters, for any employee, was their life. We lived and breathed it every single day. They were a part of this culture and brand that we created in Rifle, and there was a lot of pride with that.”In June, Boebert was told by new landlord Milken Enterprises that her lease wasn’t going to be renewed.Boebert said the letter came as a shock. She soon called the landlord but “there wasn’t really much wiggle room or anywhere to compromise unless we bought the building ourselves.”“Within the next two hours, I had reporters reaching out to me asking me if this was true and if we were being evicted,” she said. “I said, ‘Well, we’re not being evicted. The lease is not being renewed — that’s a big difference.’”The real question is, what’s next for Boebert in the restaurant industry? Will it fade away into myth like the Old West or are there plans in the works to relocate?Boebert said she doesn’t want to make any promises, but she and her husband, Jayson, are praying and planning to continue the Shooters brand, culture, name and presence on Rifle’s Third Street.“We would just dramatically scale it back, because, obviously, we’re not in our building,” she said. “It may look like a Shooters coffee shop with pastries and some easy breakfast sandwiches and merchandise.”Shooters itself originally came to fruition after Boebert spent time ministering to female inmates at Garfield County Jail. She said she wanted to give these women help and “trade their shame for glory.”Boebert would later hire some of these women after they were released, she said.The gun theme came when someone was allegedly beaten to death in front of Shooters and Boebert’s employees started asking if they could open carry.

Her early resignation was a result of Mind Springs Health coming under increased scrutiny for failing to serve many of its clients, detailed in reporting by the , along with other issues.Officials in  and  counties have taken steps to cut ties with the health care provider that relies heavily on state funding.Doug Pattison, the firm’s former chief financial officer, has been filling in an interim role since  in January.“The Board of Directors is grateful to Doug for stepping in as interim CEO during a turbulent time and for his hard work in helping improve relationships on local and state levels,” Bate said.According to Mind Springs, Sheehan started his career as a mental health tech and worked his way up through various management and executive level positions, including having a wealth of experience with in-patient care and telehealth integration.Sheehan has been at the helm of Rochester Health Information Exchange for the last year, and he and his team helped redesign the health care system in anticipation of being awarded one of the largest 1,115 waivers ever granted by the federal government.The waivers are intended to give states the option to test new approaches in Medicaid that differ from what is required by federal law and can offer states considerable flexibility in how they operate their programs.For seven years, Sheehan also served as the CEO of Harbor Toledo, one of the largest behavioral health providers in the Midwest with more than 30 treatment locations in Ohio, Michigan and Virginia.Prior to his time at Harbor Toledo, Sheehan was the vice president of Behavioral Health Services for BayCare Health System based in Clearwater, Florida, the largest nonprofit private provider of inpatient care in the state.",14.07.2022,Eli Pace,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/embattled-mental-health-care-provider-mind-springs-health-hires-new-ceo/
Criminal extortion case against Silt man heads to jury trial in June,[],"A case against a Silt man accused of harassing an undocumented immigrant is scheduled for a jury trial following a motions hearing Friday.Mark H. Aspiri, who allegedly threatened to report a undocumented immigrant if the individual didn’t pay Aspiri more than $1,000, is scheduled to appear in court for a pretrial conference June 14, and his jury trial is slated to begin June 22.  include ethnic intimidation and criminal extortion.According to Ballotpedia, Aspiri was a 2014 Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in Colorado for a brief time before dropping out.Aspiri and his attorney Chip McCrory attended a virtual motions hearing Friday, during which 9th District Judge James Boyd ruled on motions for discovery and to suppress statements.Glenwood Springs Police Department Det. Jeff Fain and Officer Alicia Hampton testified during the hearing on a motion to suppress statements.

Hampton testified she was dispatched Dec. 9, 2020, to speak with the victim and his translator, who alleged Aspiri threatened the victim during a call about missing wages. The conversation occurred over the phone, and Hampton said she followed up the allegations by contacting Aspiri and directing him not to contact the victim again. She didn’t recall if Aspiri acknowledged her directive, but told the court she advised Aspiri that he could be charged with harassment if he continued to contact the victim.McCrory questioned Hampton about taking notes during the phone call, and where those notes might be included in the incident report. Hampton said she might have written down a phone number on a notepad or entered notes on an incident report, but she did not recall which.On Dec. 10, 2020, Fain was working on patrol duties when he was also dispatched to speak over the phone with the victim and his translator, Fain testified.The conversation was brief, but Fain learned the victim was in communication with two other people who had complaints about communications with Aspiri for not being paid for work completed, according to Fain’s testimony.During the call, the victim claimed he did not know Aspiri, but Aspiri was demanding the victim pay him money or Aspiri would turn the victim into immigration, Fain said.Fain said he followed the conversation with the victim by calling Aspiri, who allegedly denied calling the victim or threatening the victim. The detective said he also called additional numbers provided by the victim to speak with people familiar with the situation.McCrory asked Fain about taking notes on the call. Fain said he did not have his notes readily available and could not guarantee he took notes, but if he did, they were likely written down in a notepad.Fain added his notes were not requested by the District Attorney’s Office as part of the case against Aspiri.Representing the DA’s Office, attorney Heidi Bauer told Boyd she filed a request for Fain’s note as a result of the Friday testimony.Boyd ruled to deny the motion to suppress statements.On motions of discovery, McCrory said his office did not receive recordings of the victim’s voicemails, which might have been provided to the police department. He also requested copies of the victim’s witnesses’ statements, copies of incident reports related to the case and any police recordings of conversation translations with the victim, who does not speak English, or non-English speaking witnesses.",02.04.2022,Ike Fredregill,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/criminal-extortion-case-against-silt-man-heads-to-jury-trial-in-june/

The charges include one count of sexual assault to multiple counts of unlawful sexual contact and invasion of privacy, according to Johnny Lombardi, a deputy district attorney in the 5th Judicial District Attorney’s Office.DA Heidi McCollum said after a brief hearing that there are now 11 named victims in the case.Gordon, 47, of New Castle, was arrested Nov. 24 by Basalt police after one of the victims contended Gordon inappropriately touched her during a massage at a Basalt business on Nov. 22. By early January, the list of alleged victims  and the alleged inappropriate touching went back to 2015 in at least one case.Gordon was released from Eagle County Jail in late November on a $25,000 personal recognizance bond. His bond conditions prohibit him from contacting the alleged victims or working as a massage therapist while the case is active.The Basalt Police Department posted a message on its Facebook page Jan. 28 urging any victims to contact the department, the DA’s office or RESPONSE, which helps victims of sexual assaults.“We believe there may be other women who were victimized by Nate Gordon while he was working as a massage therapist,” Lt. Aaron Munch said in the Facebook post.McCollum said Monday her office continues to be contacted by potential victims in the case.Four of the alleged victims appeared in court in Eagle on Monday and were prepared to testify in the preliminary hearing. Gordon’s attorney, Sherry Caloia, sought a continuance because she said she didn’t have enough time to look through all the evidence the DA’s office has presented in the case thus far. Plus, Caloia said, she had a severe head cold that affected her ability to represent Gordon effectively.Eagle County Judge Rachel Olquin-Fresquez said she was “not comfortable” with either choice — proceeding with the preliminary hearing or granting the continuance. She decided to reschedule the hearing for April 22. The DA’s office must prove there is enough evidence to warrant advancing to trial on the charges facing Gordon.",05.04.2022,Scott Condon,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/additional-alleged-victims-emerge-in-sex-case-against-basalt-massage-therapist/
Chronic drunk driver arrested again on DUI charge at Aspen airport,[],"A Roaring Fork Valley man with at least six prior drunken-driving convictions was arrested again Monday at the Aspen-Pitkin County Airport and charged with felony DUI, according to court records.Harve Hoff, 64, had to be pulled out of the backseat of his vehicle in front of the airport arrivals door by two Pitkin County sheriff’s deputies and handcuffed after refusing to cooperate, according to a warrantless arrest affidavit filed in Pitkin County District Court.Emergency dispatchers were first alerted to Hoff about 3:30 p.m. Monday after a caller reported that he smelled like alcohol and had a history of alcohol problems, the affidavit states. The person Hoff was supposed to pick up at the airport told an airport operations employee that she didn’t feel safe getting in the car with him.The airport employee reported that Hoff was sitting in the front seat of a white Lexus with Texas license plates, though he had moved to the backseat by the time a deputy arrived. Hoff refused to follow directions from the deputy and repeatedly asked the person he was picking up to drive away, according to the affidavit.Hoff was argumentative, would not get out the car, declined to speak with the deputy and had slurred, “thick-tongued” speech. He also refused to perform roadside sobriety tests and became more agitated when the deputy informed him that he was going to be arrested for drunken driving because witnesses had seen him behind the wheel.

After another deputy arrived and helped drag Hoff out of the car, they transported him to the Pitkin County Jail. In addition to the six DUI convictions, Hoff also was the subject of several protection orders filed against him that forbid him from consuming alcohol or controlled substances as well as a suspended license.Hoff, part of a longtime Pitkin County family whose latest address on file was in Glenwood Springs, has been arrested 17 times in the past 10 years by the Pitkin County Sheriff’s Office mostly for alcohol-related incidents, according to Sheriff’s Office records. He was charged Monday with felony DUI, driving with a suspended license, violating a protection order and violation of bail bonds conditions.",06.04.2022,Jason Auslander,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/chronic-drunk-driver-arrested-again-for-dui-at-aspen-airport/
Victim testifies in trial of Basalt man charged with attempted sexual assault,[],"A 24-year-old woman who was cornered in the bathroom of a downtown Aspen bar by an intoxicated man last summer didn’t hesitate Wednesday when a prosecutor asked her what she thought about his intentions.“He would’ve raped me,” she said.The woman — a Washington D.C. resident and lifelong visitor to Aspen — was the first witness to testify Wednesday in the trial of Robert Marlow, a 41-year-old Basalt man charged with attempted sexual assault, false imprisonment and indecent exposure.The victim had been out to dinner with a family friend the night of July 6 last year and ended up at Aspen Public House about 1 a.m. on July 7. She testified that she’d had two glasses of wine the entire evening and ordered water at Public House before heading to the bathroom about 15 minutes after arriving at the bar.She said she first entered the unlocked women’s bathroom and saw a tall man — later identified as Marlow — standing inside with his pants unbuttoned. She said she immediately closed the door, apologized for the intrusion and decided to use the men’s room immediately opposite the women’s room because she thought it would be a similar one-toilet facility with a locking door.

When she entered the men’s room, however, she realized it wasn’t the exact same set-up as the women’s room, hesitated a moment and testified she felt maybe she shouldn’t be in there. At that point, the man who had been in the women’s room came “barging” into the men’s room and backed her up against the wall between a toilet stall and the sink, she said.The man put his right arm up against the wall, blocking her from leaving, and with his left hand began pulling his pants and boxers down to his knees, she said. She testified that she saw his penis, but could not recall if it was flaccid or erect.“I was more focused on getting out,” she said.At that point, she began kicking and screaming at the top of her lungs, she said.“I said, ‘Please don’t do this. Please let me go,’” she said, crying on the witness stand. “And he said, ‘You’re not going anywhere.’”The woman testified that the scenario she was faced with had played out many times in her head as one of her greatest fears, and that she’d always told herself that if something like that happened she’d have 60-to-90 seconds to get out of it. In that “moment of clarity,” she said she began counting down from 60, then realized Marlow was much taller than her and that she could duck under his arm and run out of the bathroom, which she did.A video played in court Wednesday — as well as at a  — showed Marlow sitting at a table near the Public House bathrooms and entering the bathroom area seconds before the woman walked downstairs from the bar area to the bathrooms. The 53-second video was not positioned to record what occurred inside the bathrooms, but the audio portion recorded her screaming, and the video caught her running out of the bathroom.The woman said she’d never seen Marlow before in her life and did not recognize him sitting at the defense table when prosecutor Don Nottingham asked if he was in the courtroom Wednesday.She said she did not call police that night and didn’t talk to a detective until about noon on July 7. She said she had never experienced such a “trauma” before, and that she initially thought that if she ignored what happened it would go away, though that quickly turned out not to be the case.On cross-examination, public defender Scott Troxell brought up inconsistencies in the woman’s account of what happened that evening. She admitted she initially told police she spent the first night after the incident at her home when she actually stayed at the family friend’s house. She also told police at one point that she hadn’t seen Marlow’s penis, though she testified Wednesday she did see it and that the memory of seeing it came back to her.During his opening statement, Troxell said Marlow was “blackout intoxicated” the night of the incident and also had been doing cocaine. However, he said Marlow’s reaction to the cocaine was not typical and that it had caused him to hallucinate, which he chalked up to “strange powders going around Aspen.”“You will hear that he had a blank stare (on his face),” Troxell said. “There was something wrong with him.”Regardless of what Marlow ingested, he has “very little recollection of that evening,” Troxell said.Troxell said the victim clearly believed she was about to be raped but that what actually happened doesn’t equal attempted sexual assault with force under the law.“I won’t ask you to believe nothing happened,” Troxell told jurors. “Something happened. I’d ask you to look at the evidence. It is not attempted sexual assault with force, even if that’s what (the victim) felt it was.”Marlow’s trial — which is taking place in the basement of the former Aspen City Hall building while the Pitkin County Courthouse undergoes renovations — is scheduled to run through Monday.",07.04.2022,Jason Auslander,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/victim-testifies-in-trial-of-basalt-man-charged-with-attempted-sexual-assault/

The agreement includes a six-month deferred judgment, meaning the conviction will be removed from Fornell’s record if he isn’t cited for any criminal transgressions through the first week of October. The city has 90 days to request a restitution amount from Fornell, which he can either accept or challenge, said Assistant City Attorney Kate Johnson.Fornell turned himself in to Aspen police March 7, admitting to them that he spray-painted the cafe, which is located at the base of Aspen Mountain near the gondola. Based on photographs obtained by The Aspen Times and Aspen police, the  and “Liars” on another. The paint was removed the next day, which was a Sunday.“I’m here today to admit my actions at the Gorsuch Cafe on March 5,” Fornell read from a statement to the court Wednesday. “I acted in an irresponsible way and I regret my methods. It was ill-conceived and a poor attempt to exercise my right to free speech. Had I taken time to assess the situation, I would have taken a more healthy approach to expressing my opinion.”Fornell’s remarks came after Judge Brooke Peterson allowed Gorsuch to give a statement, which began when he pulled up a seat near Fornell, looked him in the face and said, “Honestly, I don’t know you well. I don’t know what could have possibly been in your mind thinking this was the right behavior.”Peterson then stopped Gorsuch.“Mr. Gorsuch, address me,” the judge said.Gorsuch then turned to Peterson and said Fornell’s actions went too far and harmed a family that has been part of the community for more than a half-century.“What happened that Sunday morning or the evening before is not acceptable behavior in the community, in the city and the community where we all strive to do a good job and take care of guests, and my guests were greeted by that violent red paint that basically called me and my family liars and said ‘leave and go away from here,’” Gorsuch said. “And you know what, we’ve been in the Aspen and the retail community for 50 years. And we’ve tried to do a lot of right things for the community and supporting the community we live and work in.“I find the behavior despicable and wrong and the slippery slope that it was on caused great havoc in the public and in my presence, in my business, to my people that work for me and to my family that lives here.”Gorsuch’s attorney Matt Ferguson argued the case belonged in either county or district court where misdemeanor and felony cases are handled and punishments are more severe.“If you watched the news this morning, you’ll see what the Russian troops have been doing — putting V’s all over municipal buildings there (in Ukraine),” Ferguson said. “When people destroy windows, it means a lot in our society. These things have happened, and when you write something like ‘liars’ and ‘get out of town’ and ‘go back to Vail,’ that’s intimidation. And that’s what Jeff and Jeff Gorsuch’s family felt, that’s what his children feel. They’ve been yelled at in cars because of this incident. They’re scared. This is the wrong thing to do.”Fornell  he was outraged after Gorsuch and his partners flipped nearly an acre of land on Aspen Mountain after buying it for $10 million from Aspen Skiing Co. the previous July.The flipped land came with entitlements to build a voter-approved hotel, and was acquired by an affiliate of a Miami-based developer of luxury hotels called OKO Group, which is led by Russian-born billionaire Vladislav Doronin.The local team of Jim DeFrancia, Gorsuch and Bryan Peterson were the face of the 2019 campaign for an 81-room Gorsuch Haus to be built at the base of the west side of Aspen Mountain near Lift One. That March, Aspen’s electorate approved the Gorsuch Haus and associated developments by 26 votes.Fornell, himself a developer, also apologized to a number of people with one notable exception.“I want to extend my apologies to the Aspen Police Department for occupying their time,” Fornell’s statement continued. “My apologies also go to the Aspen City Attorney’s Office for having to deal with this matter. Finally, I apologize to the court. And to your honor, you have far more important matters to attend to. I regret that I have taken your valuable time and I am truly sorry. Be certain that I take this matter seriously and I intend to live up to the obligations of the plea agreement. I try to be a good citizen, and I know that my future actions will show that I’m capable of doing so.”Ferguson then pointed out the omission.“I would like to note who was not apologized to,” Ferguson said.Replied Judge Peterson: “I got it.”The Aspen Municipal Code describes the charge against Fornell — injury to public and private property prohibited — as “unlawful for any person to intentionally or knowingly to injure, deface, mutilate, remove, pull down, break or in any way interfere with or molest or secrete any trees, real or personal property belonging to or under the control of the City or any person within the City.”Johnson said the plea agreement with Fornell is similar to other deals the city has made for the same offense. She also noted Fornell does not have a criminal history, which factored into the outcome.“I appreciate the victim’s statements here, but I do have to say that I think this is a fair and just resolution to these charges,” Johnson said. “It is similar to other situations that this court has addressed on the charge of injuring private property. There have been similar situations that have happened in town. Again, this has a political flair to it but the actual act itself is similar to other acts this court has dealt with.”Peterson agreed the agreement was appropriate.“I note and recognize that Mr. Fornell, at least in my knowledge, has not apologized to the Gorsuch family and to Mr. Gorsuch, but that’s his decision and I cannot force an apology out of him,” the judge said. “That being said, I still believe the stipulation is the right way to deal with the criminal aspect of these actions, and the restitution issue remains to be seen. But for the moment and until that restitution comes back to me, the matter is closed as far as the stipulation is concerned.”The judge said he had to treat Fornell like any other defendant charged with the same offense, despite the high-profile nature of the vandalism.“I recognize that this has been hurtful to the Gorsuch family, but I’m not sure that this court can impose a higher penalty to change that,” he said.As a member of the Aspen Historic Preservation Commission’s board of directors, Fornell has a responsibility to behave well, Ferguson said.“Mr. Fornell sits on the HPC board and he’s supposed to show good judgment,” Ferguson said. “What he did was an abomination. You can’t tell people to leave town and call them liars.”It cost Gorsuch around $2,500 to remove the spray-paint job, which was not water based, Ferguson said. Fornell said previously he intentionally used easy-to-remove water-based red paint.There could be future civil action over the incident, Ferguson said.“The bottom line is we’ve been pressing the DA to take this up as a misdemeanor or a minor felony because he has done damage,” Ferguson said. “We don’t think it was water-based paint. It took the entire day to get that paint off and it did cost about $2,500. In addition, Mr. Gorsuch has had to retain publicists and put in numerous ads in the papers, run his letters, and try to rebut some of the damage that has been done here.”The Gorsuch family is known for their skiing prowess, evidenced by Jeff Gorsuch’s 2019 induction into the Colorado Ski and Snowboard Hall of Fame, joining his parents and grandfather. The family name also can be seen on ski apparel shops throughout the state. Jeff Gorsuch’s father, , is considered one of Vail’s pioneers.

Jurors to resume deliberations Monday in attempted sex assault trial,[],"After spending most of Friday afternoon deliberating the fate of a Basalt man charged with attempting to rape an Aspen visitor in the bathroom of a downtown bar last summer, jurors were sent home after 5 p.m. without coming to a verdict.Deliberations will resume Monday morning.Robert Marlow, 41, is charged with attempted sexual assault, false imprisonment and indecent exposure in relation to the incident, which occurred at Aspen Public House in the early morning hours of July 7.Jurors received the case about 12:30 p.m. after lawyers concluded closing arguments and deliberated until about 5:20 p.m., when District Judge Chris Seldin called them back into the courtroom to check on their progress. At least two jurors indicated they had other obligations and could not continue the deliberations Friday evening, and Seldin sent them home for the weekend.The 24-year-old victim in the case — a resident of Washington, D.C. — testified Wednesday that a drunken Marlow followed her in to a bathroom at Public House about 1 a.m., forced her up against the wall, blocked her from leaving, pulled down his pants and boxers and told her she couldn’t leave. The woman, who was convinced she was about to be raped, said she screamed, then kicked and punched Marlow before ducking under his arm and running out.

Marlow testified in his own defense Friday and told jurors he worked as a heavy equipment operator in Glenwood Springs during the day on July 6, then met a friend for two beers at a brewery nearby. He said he returned to his home at Aspen Skiing Co.’s tiny-home development — he worked for Skico as a lift mechanic the previous winter — in the mid-Roaring Fork Valley, where he ate and showered.Marlow said he then drove to Aspen and went to Eric’s Bar, where he was employed as a security doorman but was not on duty that night, and had five beers and two shots. He also said he “scored” a gram of cocaine from a co-worker at the bar and did two or three “key bumps” in the bathroom.Marlow testified that he’d done cocaine more than 50 times before, but that this time it affected him differently and made him sluggish and discombobulated instead of stimulated. Not long after ingesting the cocaine, he said his co-worker noticed he was very intoxicated and asked him to leave the bar “before you make an ass of yourself.”“I definitely appeared pretty wasted to him,” Marlow said.He then walked over the Aspen Public House, where he said he was thinking of doing more cocaine. He testified that he remembered sitting down at a table near the bathrooms and remembered getting up to go to the bathroom to do more drugs.That was when Marlow said he remembered hearing a woman scream, but had “no clue what was going on.”“Obviously there was a woman in the bathroom and she ran out the door,” he said.He then left the bar after a bartender asked him to go, and walked around Aspen aimlessly looking for his car while hallucinating lights and colors until 4:30 a.m. When police showed up at his home two days later, Marlow said he didn’t know why they were there and thought maybe he’d gotten into a fight.Prosecutor Don Nottingham, however, played a video of Marlow’s interview with an Aspen Police detective, where he said he remembered a girl screaming. Marlow then admitted he knew the police visit had to do with his interaction in the bathroom with the woman who screamed.Marlow said he “froze” when he heard the scream and recalled the woman running out the bathroom door.“Anybody that screams like that — it is terrifying,” he said. “Because it is an emergency sound. They were loud. They were very scary — like horror movie screams. It did scare me and it did make me freeze.”Nottingham pointed out that Marlow appeared to remember many details of the night, except the 15 seconds when the victim screamed, kicked and punched her way out of the bathroom, the audio of which was recorded on a video surveillance camera outside the bathrooms. Marlow confirmed that he did not remember what happened inside the bathroom.“Of course, that’s when his memory goes blank,” Nottingham said in his closing arguments. “If he wasn’t trying to sexually assault her in the Public House bathroom, what could he possibly have been doing? What other possible explanation can there be for that? There is none.”Scott Troxell, Marlow’s public defender, cast doubt on the victim’s version of events, criticized police for not gathering DNA evidence or even photos of the victim’s alleged bruises and said the facts “fall short of what is alleged by the prosecution.” He said her clothes were not ruffled or stretched and that there was no proof Marlow committed any act of force on her.“(The victim) was traumatized,” Troxell said. “But that doesn’t mean everything that came out of her mouth (in testimony) was the truth.”He said Marlow never assaulted the woman.“I ask you to find that Mr. Marlow did not commit any act of force on the victim,” Troxell said. “If anything, it was unlawful sexual contact.”",09.04.2022,Jason Auslander,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/jurors-to-resume-deliberations-monday-in-attempted-sex-assault-trial/
Bond review scheduled in Glenwood Springs stabbing ahead of defendant’s 18th birthday,[],"A juvenile defendant charged as an adult for attempted murder in a March 8 stabbing incident at a south Glenwood Springs home had his first hearing in adult court Thursday.The next step before Angel Rivas Tellez turns 18 on May 13 will be to review a $250,000 bond that was set last month when the 9th District Attorney’s Office charged him as an adult and refiled his case in Garfield County District Court.Once Tellez turns 18, he will have to be transferred from the Grand Mesa Youth Detention Center to the Garfield County Jail, unless he is able to make bond, public defender Elise Myer told District Judge James Boyd at the Thursday hearing.Boyd agreed to set a bond review hearing ahead of that key date, the afternoon of April 22.At a March 23 juvenile court hearing, Myer requested a much lower bond of $15,000-$20,000.

Myer also anticipates requesting what’s called a reverse-transfer hearing, where the judge would be asked to determine if the case should be moved back to juvenile court.That’s unlikely to occur until a clinical psychologist can evaluate Tellez and provide a report. The earliest that could happen is June 9, Myer said.In the meantime, she said she is still reviewing discovery from the police investigation in the case, including body camera footage and medical records of the alleged victim.Tellez faces felony charges of attempted murder and burglary for allegedly breaking into the victim’s home using a crowbar on a basement window around 2 a.m. March 8, going to the man’s bedroom and stabbing him “at least 30 times” before fleeing the scene, according to an account provided by Deputy District Attorney Tony Hershey at the March court hearing.The victim was transported to an area hospital and survived his injuries.At the Thursday hearing, Hershey asked that a protection order in place for the victims in the case, including a third-party acquaintance of Tellez and the victim, be transferred from the juvenile case to the new District Court case. Judge Boyd agreed.In the earlier hearing, Hershey painted a picture of a premeditated crime in which Tellez allegedly played crime games with friends and kept notes on how to break into a home with the intent of committing a violent crime.Following the incident, the surrounding neighborhood was initially on high alert while Glenwood Springs police investigated. Tellez was quickly identified as a likely suspect, and police indicated there was not an immediate public threat.Hershey said at the March 23 hearing that there were enough concerns expressed by officials at Tellez’s school in Glenwood Springs that the higher bond is warranted. Additional evidence has been provided on that front, Hershey said Thursday.",09.04.2022,John Stroud,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/bond-review-scheduled-in-glenwood-springs-stabbing-ahead-of-defendants-18th-birthday/
Jury finds Basalt man guilty of attack on woman in bar bathroom,['https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=9223d685-d83c-5dd5-b592-68d4b9fc0a3b&type=preview&width=300&height=381&q=60'],"A Pitkin County jury on Monday found a Basalt man guilty of attempted sexual assault, false imprisonment and indecent exposure for attacking an Aspen visitor in the bathroom of a downtown bar last summer.Robert Marlow, 41, now faces possible life in prison when he is sentenced June 21.The jury of seven women and five men spent nearly all of Friday afternoon and all of Monday morning deliberating before coming back with the verdict just before 1 p.m. In addition to the findings of guilt on all counts, jurors also found that Marlow used “force of violence” in attempting to sexually assault the then-23-year-old woman.That finding is particularly significant because it means Marlow is guilty of a higher level felony and will face 2-to-6 years to life in prison and 10 years to life on parole when and if he’s released from prison, said Deputy District Attorney Don Nottingham, who prosecuted the case. Marlow would have been looking at between 1 and 3 years in prison if the jury had found him guilty of attempted sexual assault without the force of violence finding.Indecent exposure and false imprisonment are misdemeanors for which Marlow can receive up to 18 months and up to 364 days respectively.The Pitkin County Probation Department will conduct both a pre-sentence investigation and psycho-sexual evaluation prior to the June sentencing date.Attorneys in the case spent almost as much time picking the jury as they did presenting evidence in the case. Jury selection took all of April 5 and half of the next day. Testimony and arguments in the case occurred Wednesday afternoon, Thursday morning and Friday morning.The first witness to testify was the now-24-year-old victim in the case, a resident of Washington, D.C.,  she had been coming to visit Aspen her entire life because her parents met here.She described a night out July 6 with a family friend that finished up at Aspen Public House about 1 a.m. July 7. The woman said she’d had two glasses of wine the entire night, ordered water at the Public House bar when she arrived, then went to use the bathroom about 15 minutes later.She said she first went to the women’s bathroom, but when she opened the door she encountered Marlow standing inside with his pants unbuttoned. She described being slightly embarrassed, apologized and shut the door.The woman said she decided to use the men’s bathroom immediately across from the women’s bathroom on the assumption that it was a one-toilet facility like the women’s room and likely had a locking door. When she opened the door, however, she noticed it was set up differently with a urinal and a stall and said she hesitated a moment while deciding if she should use that bathroom.That was when she said a clearly intoxicated Marlow came “barging” through the door, backed her up against the wall between the urinal and the sink, put his right arm up to block her from leaving and began pulling down his pants and boxers. She said he exposed himself to her at that point.The woman, who is much smaller than the 6-foot-1, 260 pound Marlow, said she asked him not to do anything to her and to let her go, but he responded, “You’re not going anywhere.” She said she then began screaming, punching and kicking at Marlow and was able to duck under his arm and run out the door to safety.She later said she thought he would have raped her if she hadn’t been able to get away. A video surveillance camera outside the bathroom recorded her screams and her running away from the bathroom area.Marlow testified that he’d been drinking and doing cocaine that night and that while he remembered most details, including arriving at Public House, sitting at a table outside the bathroom and getting up to go to the bathroom to do more cocaine, he didn’t remember what occurred inside the bathroom except for the woman screaming.Marlow is currently being held at the Garfield County Jail, which is housing Pitkin County Jail inmates while county officials make changes to the jail to improve safety.",12.04.2022,Jason Auslander,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/jury-finds-basalt-man-guilty-of-attack-on-woman-in-bar-bathroom/
Hearing begins for ex-Basalt massage therapist,[],"A preliminary hearing for a former massage therapist in Basalt facing 23 counts related to sexually related transgressions with his clients will resume May 13, according to a court clerk.The hearing for  47, of New Castle, got underway at 9 a.m. Friday at Eagle County District Court.

Teen paints harrowing picture of relative’s alleged abuse in Roaring Fork Valley,[],"A Pitkin County district judge Monday bound over a Rifle man for trial to face 168 criminal charges linked to his alleged physical, psychological and sexual abuse of a relative over a period of two years, including one incident where he purportedly tried to shove her off a cliff on Aspen Mountain.Defendant Frank Seme, 44, out on a $250,000 surety bond, attended in Aspen the preliminary hearing that included brief remarks from the alleged victim, who was subpoenaed to testify by public defender Scott Troxell. Also shown during the hearing was video footage of a police detective’s interview with the girl, who said she was physically and sexually abused and traumatized by her relative starting when she was 16 years old. The physical abuse began in September 2018 and the sexual abuse in February 2019, the girl told the detective.“If it wasn’t sexual abuse, it was physical abuse and verbal abuse,” the alleged victim told the Rifle Police Sgt. Carlos Cornejo in the interview, which was conducted Oct. 28. Nearly three hours of the interview was shown during the preliminary hearing.Judge Chris Seldin’s ruling allows the prosecution to carry forward 53 felony counts of sexual assault against Seme, 30 felony counts of sexual assault on a child by a person in a position of trust constituting a pattern of abuse, 83 felony counts of aggravated incest, one count of second-degree assault and one misdemeanor count of third-degree assault.Convictions on all charges could lead to multiple life sentences in prison for Seme. The sexual assault charges are punishable by 2 to 6 years to life in prison; the incest counts carry 4 to 12 years to life in prison; and each count of sexual assault on a child by a person in a position of trust constituting a pattern of abuse is punishable by 10 to 32 years to life in prison.

Seldin noted his decision was largely based on the video of the girl’s interview with the Rifle police sergeant, as well as her documenting each alleged sexual encounter — including multiple instances of intercourse — on her health app’s calendar.“We have non-hearsay testimony to support the charge in each count,” Judge Seldin said.According to the alleged victim’s statement to police, she moved from her home in Nebraska to her relative’s Old Snowmass-area home in June 2018, and began her junior year at a high school in the Roaring Fork Valley that fall. In September just before her 17th birthday, Seme became mad at her and beat her with a hairbrush. He was intoxicated then and normally would drink 12 beers a day, she said.The sexual abuse began in the following February and became progressively worse.“It’s been going on since I was 17 and we lived in Snowmass,” she told Cornejo.The alleged victim said she couldn’t break away from her relative because she felt helpless. She also told Rifle police that before her interview with them, she spent 25 minutes outside the department before she could gather herself to tell her story.“I feel stupid for letting this go on that long … and I feel guilty for never fighting back,” she said.The girl recalled an episode in July 2019, one day before she was scheduled to take her senior pictures, when the relative took her four-wheeling up the backside of Aspen Mountain. At one point the vehicle stopped, and he wrapped a seat belt around her neck in an attempt to rape her but she was able to break free, she told Rifle police.“We were in the middle of nowhere,” she said. “I didn’t have a cellphone; I didn’t have anything.”Seme later tried to push her off a cliff but did not succeed, she said.“He dislocated his shoulder and screamed at me and said it was my fault,” she told police.The following October the two went to a show at Belly Up Aspen, and on the way back, while the girl was driving them home, Seme demanded she stop the car and have sex with him, she said. He also was drunk at the time, she told authorities.She resisted then and he struck her, and when they returned home she became sick before he sexually assaulted her, she said.“The threats and fear, what she felt, were the means and consequences that allowed [Seme] to continue the abuse,” Nottingham said during closing statements.After her relative kicked her out of his home in October, the victim reported the crimes to police in Rifle, where Seme was living then. Cornejo later notified Pitkin County authorities about the crimes the girl reported that occurred in Pitkin County.Seme is out on $250,000 surety bond after authorities arrested him in December. He is due back court in June 6 for an arraignment hearing.Monday’s hearing was held in a makeshift courtroom downstairs at the old Aspen City Hall building, while renovations continue at Pitkin County Courthouse on Main Street.",26.04.2022,Rick Carroll,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/teen-paints-harrowing-picture-of-relatives-alleged-abuse-in-roaring-fork-valley/

He was wanted for the fatal shooting of an 18-year-old male at the celebration on Home Ranch Road shortly after midnight Sunday.Garfield County Sheriff’s deputies arrived to find the victim still alive, but he was later pronounced dead at St. Mary’s Hospital in Grand Junction.Garfield County District Court Judge Paul Metzger made the order to detain Lopez without bond during the Rifle juvenile’s initial appearance Tuesday morning.“Under these circumstances, having reviewed the affidavit and considered the arguments of the parties, I do ultimately conclude that the juvenile poses a substantial risk of serious harm to others, and therefore find that he should remain in detention at this time,” Metzger said.According to prosecuting attorney Tony Hershey, Lopez was already on probation for felony menacing with a knife prior to his Monday arrest. Meanwhile, Lopez also allegedly possessed two handguns and brass knuckles when he was arrested by the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office on Monday.“After the incident in this case, (Lopez) did flee the county, he went to Mesa County,” Hershey said. “I believe at some point he was contacted by his mother and sister, and that’s when he was apprehended.”Garfield County public defender Elise Myer requested Lopez be released from detention because he does not pose a flight risk and that facts in connection to his new homicide case are currently “limited.”Myer also said Lopez has been abiding to the terms of his probation and was working concrete with his father prior to his Monday arrest.“These are incredibly serious crimes, but he is presumed innocent,” Myer said. “D’Antiago is willing to abide by any conditions the court may put on a release. He is happy to stay at home with his family, to not leave. He has a good relationship with his family, with his parents, with his siblings.”Lopez’s next court date is set for May 11.",27.04.2022,,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/rifle-juvenile-suspected-in-fatal-shooting-held-without-bond-judge-orders/
"Basalt bartender’s disdain for local vodka triggers incident that leads to arrest on suspicion of menacing, assault",['https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=2b8b2e54-d1c3-5142-9eae-94c6df8054bb&type=preview&width=300&height=375&q=60'],"A Basalt bartender was arrested on suspicion of felony menacing, stalking and three misdemeanors after he allegedly went into a violent rage Tuesday when he learned a customer worked for Woody Creek Distillery.Christopher D. Barker, 43, of Aspen Village, was arrested after a tense 20 minutes that included his alleged assault of his boss and another co-worker, pursuit of two customers outside of the restaurant and a confrontation with another man who intervened, according to Basalt Police Chief Greg Knott. Barker allegedly pulled a knife on the intervenor and the intervenor responded by pulling a handgun, according to an affidavit for a warrantless arrest filed in Eagle County District Court by Basalt police.Knott said it was fortunate the episode didn’t end in tragedy after the intervenor pulled his handgun out of a holster during the chaotic moments when the first officer, Lt. Aaron Munch, arrived on the scene. The intervenor intended to show he posed no threat to officers but the action of pulling his gun could have easily been misconstrued, Knott said.“Lt. Munch showed great restraint and control of the situation,” Knott said.The arrest warrant said a woman was drinking at the Ocean restaurant’s bar in Willits Town Center with a male companion at about 4:30 p.m. Tuesday when Barker noticed the Woody Creek Distillery logo on the woman’s shirt.“Christopher commented stating something to the effect of ‘Your vodka sucks,’” the arrest affidavit said. “Christopher continue to give his negative opinion on Woody Creek Distillery, making it extremely uncomfortable for (the woman and man).”The customers decided to leave but Barker continued to be aggressive toward them, according to police. The owner of the restaurant and other employees tried to restrain Barker as he attempted to chase the man and woman as they departed. The owner later told police he feared Barker wanted to physically harm the woman.Barker allegedly elbowed his boss in the face and punched him in the stomach as Barker attempted to get at the customers. Barker also allegedly slammed another co-worker’s hand in the door while employees were trying to prevent him from attacking the customers.Several employees of the restaurant restrained Barker while the customers departed. The customers initially entered a neighboring restaurant but left when they found it too full. Meanwhile, the Ocean’s owner ordered Barker out of the restaurant.Barker and the two customers made contact by chance about 1½ blocks away from Ocean restaurant. He flipped them off while they flipped him off, the affidavit said. Barker allegedly gave chase and the couple ducked into a nearby business seeking refuge.“(The female customer) was hiding in one of the offices as (the male customer) and staff requested (Barker) leave,” the affidavit said.The woman later told police she feared for her life while she was in hiding. She called a friend who lives nearby in Willits. The friend’s husband heard about the woman’s predicament and decided to help, Knott said. The intervenor went to the business where the woman was hiding and got into a physical altercation with Barker, according to witnesses.Barker allegedly pulled out a knife used by bartenders to open wine bottles and threatened the intervenor, the affidavit said. The intervenor “showed Christopher that he had a gun,” the affidavit said. “Christopher continued to threaten (the intervenor) as he moved towards him. (The intervenor) then pulled the gun out and pointed it at Christopher.”Barker dropped his knife shortly before Lt. Munch arrived at the scene. The 911 calls to police dispatch disclosed that weapons were involved, so Munch exited his car with his handgun drawn.Munch encountered a scene at the sidewalk along Robinson Street with one man screaming (Barker) and another man (the intervenor) a short distance away with a pistol visible in his holster, according to footage from Munch’s body cam. The Aspen Times reviewed that footage.Munch ordered the man with the gun to get down on his knees and as the man started to comply, he calmly pulled his pistol out of the holster and set it on the ground. Munch was clearly concerned while the man was pulling out the handgun and screamed at the man to get face down to the ground and then crawl away from the gun. Almost simultaneously he ordered Barker to sit on the sidewalk. Another officer arrived and both men were placed in handcuffs for “investigative custody,” the affidavit said.Knott said he interviewed the man who intervened in the dispute and learned he had intended to show he was compliant when he removed the pistol from the holster. He said he later realized his action could have been construed differently by the police officer, according to Knott.The intervenor wasn’t arrested though Basalt police asked the 5th Judicial District Attorney’s Office to review the incident and rule whether a charge was warranted.Multiple witnesses, some with videos, confirmed that the intervenor pulled his handgun only after Barker made threats with a knife and allegedly yelled “I’m going to kill you,” according to the affidavit.Officer Nino Santiago questioned Barker and said he smelled alcohol on Barker’s breath. Barker admitted he was drinking that day and that he had experienced some mental health issues, the affidavit said.Barker was arrested on suspicion of two counts of third-degree assault for actions against two of his co-workers who tried to restrain him at Ocean. He was also arrested on suspicion of criminal mischief for other actions at the restaurant.Barker was arrested on a charge of suspicion of stalking, a class 5 felony, for following the female and male customers out of Ocean. He was arrested on suspicion of felony menacing for pulling the knife and threatening the intervenor.He was taken to Eagle County Detention Center on Tuesday night. Jail records show he was released Wednesday after posting $2,500 bail.

Johnsons retain counsel in $5.2 million fraud suit,['https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=352beebb-1ea7-55c0-9a77-27923b8f9c95&type=preview&width=300&height=450&q=60'],"Attorneys for a local couple entangled in a multimillion-dollar fraud lawsuit with the insurer of Aspen Skiing Co. are disputing the amount allegedly owed.Derek and Kerri Johnson face a federal lawsuit filed in November by National Union Fire Insurance of Pittsburgh, which is seeking $5.2 million from the couple.That’s the amount the company said it covered for Aspen Skiing Co. and parent Henry Crown and Co.’s financial losses stemming from the couple’s ski-selling scam when Derek Johnson held an executive position with Skico. Skico and Henry Crown and Co. were reimbursed through their their “employee dishonesty” coverage with National Union Insurance. The suit maintains the Johnsons should be held responsible for that amount because of the fraudulent activity they carried out from 2006 to 2018 leading to their criminal convictions.“Defendants dispute that the amount paid was proper,” was the entire stated position of the Johnsons in a proposed scheduling order introduced Monday in U.S. District Court. Attorneys on both sides jointly filed the proposal.The Johnsons, in accordance with a court order, retained the pro bono defense counsel of Joshua Landy and David Tenner on April 26, according to filings. Landy and Tenner did not respond to a message seeking comment Wednesday.“Defendant Derek Johnson, in his capacity as managing director for Aspen (Skiing Co.), purposely purchased more inventory than was actually needed by Aspen so that any inventory misappropriated by Mr. Johnson was more likely to go unnoticed by Aspen,” read an excerpt from the summary of the allegations, which was included in the proposed scheduling order. “After that inventory was misappropriated by Mr. Johnson, he removed the insignia from the inventory that identified it as property of Aspen and listed the misappropriated inventory for sale online. The Defendants accepted payment from the misappropriated inventory and shipped the misappropriated inventory to buyers in boxes that were also misappropriated from Aspen.”Each Johnson admitted criminal wrongdoing. Derek Johnson, also a former Aspen City Council member, pleaded guilty in November 2019 to Class 3 felony theft and was sentenced the following January to six years in state prison. He was released from a halfway house in the Denver area in February. Kerri Johnson was not a Skico employee; she pleaded guilty to Class 4 felony theft in December 2019 and was sentenced to 90 days in the Pitkin County Jail and five years of probation.The Aspen Times asked Johnson in February, before he and his wife had counsel in the lawsuit, about the business arrangement he initially had with Aspen Skiing Co. in 2001. That year, Skico acquired a company Johnson co-founded in 1993 — D&E Ski and Snowboard Shops — and made Johnson its managing director of retail and rental operations., Johnson said he and Skico initially had an arrangement where he would sell dated inventory online.“This started at 100% legit … and it was a normal practice and then it snowballed,” he said in comments that were not printed in the original interview story. “I let that happen. I let it get away from me. I didn’t pay attention. I can make it sound so clean and sterile and appropriate, but I f—ed up. One hundred percent f—ed up … and one year led to two led to three led to four. I f—ed up.”Asked about how he justified doing it at the time, Johnson said: “My rationale was this stuff is obsolete. That was my rationale. Again, my rationale, my f–k up, my wrong, my bad. It’s much easier to look at today. I was in a different place, I was in a different world. I was in a different person.”Magistrate Judge Gordon P.

A conviction carries a presumptive prison range of two to six years, but the plea agreement strayed from those guidelines given Diamond’s age and her admission of guilt and remorse, attorneys said. She also was not intoxicated at the time of the collision, according to prosecutor Don Nottingham.Diamond agreed to supervised probation for the next two years as part of the agreement. She also must perform 120 hours of community service, which Diamond already is close to completing through her volunteer work at a soup kitchen in South Florida, according to her defense counsel, Kate Stimson of the Denver firm Stimson Stancil LaBranche Hubbard LLC.The felony will be removed from Diamond’s record if she successfully completes her probation without any criminal citations or arrests. Diamond also pleaded guilty to careless driving causing injury relating to the December incident, and she entered a guilty plea to a careless driving charge related to a different incident in July.Diamond sat next to her mother during the entire virtual arraignment hearing, which was held nearly five months after she drove a Range Rover into a Basalt man crossing East Main Street in front of the Aspen Police Department building. Victim Dave Rossi was alone crossing the street when the SUV struck him at approximately 11:52 p.m. Dec. 21, authorities said.“Certainly the most aggravating part of this case is not Ms. Diamond’s driving, which was not the greatest,” said Nottingham, adding that “it’s the fact that she left the scene. She got out of her car, saw Mr. Rossi, and left the scene, which could be described as disgusting, abhorrent, really bad behavior, really dangerous behavior. Luckily this did happen in a populated area where there were other people there who did give Mr. Rossi the help that he needed.“Rossi , among other injuries.“It caused really significant injuries to Mr. Rossi,” said Nottingham. “There was certainly concern that Mr. Rossi might die from those injuries. He had to be transported via helicopter (to Denver) … from Aspen to a more capable hospital for dealing with that level of trauma.”Rossi’s attorney, Michael Fox, attended the hearing and did not object to the plea agreement. Diamond also will be ordered to pay restitution as part of the deal, though the amount has not yet been determined.“Mr. Rossi is not here, and he does not wish to make a statement, and I don’t wish to make a statement,” Fox said.Aspen police, aided by community tips and video footage that showed the green Land Rover that Diamond was driving, arrested Diamond the day after the accident at her mother and stepfather’s Aspen residence. Diamond has taken responsibility for what happened ever since police arrested her, Nottingham said.“I would say from about that moment on, Ms. Diamond has done things just about as well as she can,” Nottingham said. “She admitted to what happened. Her mother and stepfather behaved appropriately with the appropriate amount of shock, I think, for finding out this had happened and not a desire to hide Ms. Diamond’s behavior.”Diamond made a poor choice and panicked when she left the scene, Stimson said, noting it was dark outside and she did not see Rossi because of “how he was crossing.”“Her driving was not compromised, but she did strike him,” Stimson said. “She did pull over. There were other people who attended and called 911. Then she made a bad decision of leaving. She’s a senior in high school, 18 years old, and she just made a bad decision.”Diamond will graduate this month, after which she will begin her jail sentence. She plans to attend college in California this fall.Diamond will need permission from California’s legal authorities to continue her supervised probation when she’s in school. Diamond plans to stay with her parents this summer and start college around fall. As part of her probation, she cannot consume alcohol or marijuana.There was no evidence showing that Diamond was under the influence when she hit Rossi, Nottingham said.“I’m convinced that Ms. Diamond was not intoxicated,” he said. “But I don’t think, necessarily, that she, as young person, has sustained from that sort of behavior, and I do have concerns in that regard, but the evidence on a whole indicates she was not intoxicated; she was simply an 18-year-old who panicked and did something really stupid. Stupid and dangerous, I should say, and left Mr. Rossi at the scene.”In an Aspen Times , Rossi said he harbored no ill will toward Diamond.“He appears to be a remarkably forgiving person where someone might be angry and vindictive about this having happened to them,” Nottingham said.Diamond also has demonstrated that she has learned a lesson, said Nottingham.“I think that says something about Diamond, that she has agreed to that (going to jail), from the point of view that she recognizes that this is where she ends up if she continues to engage in behavior like this,” he said. “I expect her to complete this deferred-judgment sentence successfully.”Likewise, Stimson said the sentence is appropriate.“It does allow her to move on with her life and put this behind her, but it also recognizes the severity of what happened,” she said, noting what Rossi experienced “was horrible.”Diamond is the daughter of Aspenite Sue Hostetler, who is married to billionaire William Wrigley Jr.“In a case like this, knowing Ms. Diamond’s age and her socio-economic position, is that Ms. Diamond may think that she’s the sort of person that gets in less trouble than some others, doesn’t see herself in the same population as some of the folks who go before a district court judge,” Nottingham said. “And it’s important to my office, it’s important to me, that she recognizes that her behavior in the eyes of the law doesn’t depend on what car she’s driving or what college she’s going to or anything else.

Warrant active for man accused of ripping off Aspen restaurants,['https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=c9eb061c-4960-5c8f-89dc-a405fafa71b1&type=preview&width=357&height=436&q=60'],"A man is wanted for failing to appear in court last week to answer charges that he allegedly stole fine cigars and a bottle of wine from an Aspen liquor store and refused to pay for two restaurant meals because he said one was tainted with pork and the other with hair.Pitkin County Judge Ashley Andrews issued a warrant for the arrest of Shawn Auer at the close of courthouse hours May 17 after he allegedly failed to appear for a status conference concerning a multitude of offenses he faces. The charges recently were consolidated into one case.“I’m concerned that there could be a another theft and really I’m concerned Mr. Auer is not going to show up for court,” said prosecutor Wes Stokes, noting Auer’s criminal history includes charges of shoplifting and theft in New Mexico, where he also failed to make scheduled court appearances. Stokes’ remarks came during last week’s court session where Auer was a no-show.Charging documents for Auer list his current residence as Belleville, Illinois, and his age as 48. He remained at large as of Monday, according to officials.Auer’s recent dust-ups at local businesses are documented in police filings.• May 6 — Aspen police were called to Steakhouse 316 on East Hopkins Avenue for report of a patron who was unhappy with his meal because of a strand of hair he claimed was in his food. The diner, Auer, was comped for the food containing the hair but refused to pay for the rest of the meal, according to a police report.“Auer adamantly refused to pay his bill and I explained to him that if he has an issue with the restaurant what avenues he could take, but he can’t eat and drink and not pay his bill,” responding Officer Amanda Severin wrote in the report. “Auer didn’t seem to care. I asked him numerous times if he would pay the bill and Auer said he will not pay the bill and to arrest him.”Police did that and took him to Aspen Police Department and an officer issued a summons for misdemeanor theft, read him his rights and told him not to return to the restaurant or face trespassing charges.• May 13 — Shortly after 7 p.m., police arrested Auer at the Red Mountain Grill at the Aspen Golf Course after he allegedly refused to pay a bill for a meal he had there earlier in the week. Auer was on the premises that day looking for rental clubs, and Red Mountain Grill management had kept the receipt for his unpaid meal from days earlier. When a manager confronted Auer about the outstanding receipt, “Auer became belligerent with the staff by yelling and cussing at them, and posturing like he was going to fight,” according to a witness statement to police.Police arrived and Auer denied any wrongdoing, according to a report from Officer Severin, who had cited him a week earlier for the hair-in-the-food dispute.“I told Auer he is making it a habit of eating at places and refusing to pay,” said Severin’s report of the May 13 incident. “Auer yelled at me that Red Mountain Grill poisoned him by serving him pork.”Auer had previously complained that the restaurant staff had “poisoned him” because he’s “100% Jewish” and can’t consume pork.Management also said Auer had been scheduling tee times at the course under the name of “Leo Christ” but was not keeping his appointments.Again, police took Auer took to downtown headquarters where he was summonsed for misdemeanor theft and disorderly conduct. Police also let Auer know he’d been 86ed from Red Mountain Grill and the golf club. He was then released from custody.• May 13 — Later on that date, at approximately 9:01 p.m., police received a call from The Aspen Store about a man who swiped some power drinks and was behaving aggressively toward the store clerk. Auer was not at the store at the time police responded, but Officer Ritchie Zah located him down the block in the dining area outside of Mi Chola, according to a report from Officer Roderick O’Connor.“I asked Auer, who was smoking a cigar, about his stealing drinks from The Aspen Store and where the bag he took was located,” O’Connor’s report said. “Auer was not forthcoming about the bag, but mentioned he was at Mi Chola to eat.”O’Connor, however, arrested Auer for theft after he found the power drinks in a bag Auer had left inside the restaurant. It was the second time in the same evening Auer had been cited for theft, but the pork meal and power drinks weren’t all he had allegedly taken.Officer Severin, who also reported to Mi Chola, also found Auer in possession of one bottle of Opus One Cabernet with a price tag of $389.99, along with four cigars valued at $52.87. Those items had been swiped from the Local Spirits shop next to The Aspen Store, O’Connor reported.Auer appeared for his advisement on May 14, but that is the last authorities had heard of him as of Monday.",24.05.2022,Rick Carroll,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/warrant-active-for-man-accused-of-ripping-off-aspen-restaurants/
One juvenile charged after gel-bead gun shooting incident in Carbondale,[],"One juvenile suspect is facing menacing and assault charges after allegedly shooting a toy gun designed to discharge Orbeez gel beads at students and others on Thursday.Initially, three juveniles were detained by Carbondale police after receiving a  of the gel beads being fired at a group of middle school students in Miners Park, and later at adults in the downtown area.“Information shared by the juveniles and other witnesses and evidence collected led Carbondale officers to contact two other juveniles,” a Carbondale Police Department news release issued on Friday stated.The juvenile suspects were allegedly riding in the silver sedan shooting Orbeez, a type of non-lethal soft gel bead, at students who were on a school outing in the park.Another vehicle initially identified by the victims and witnesses was not involved in the incident, the release stated.

One juvenile was ultimately charged with six counts each of menacing and third-degree assault.“At this time, the juvenile is innocent until proven guilty,” the release states.Carbondale officers are still seeking help in locating any other witnesses who might have seen the incident that allegedly occurred downtown, by calling 970-963-2662.“Carbondale Police Department wants to encourage parents to talk to their kids about how dangerous it can be to use any type of weapon including non-lethal,” the release states.",31.05.2022,,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/one-juvenile-charged-after-gel-bead-gun-shooting-incident-in-carbondale/

His bond was set at $1 million, and his arraignment was Thursday with 9th Judicial District Court Judge John Neiley.Nielsen is scheduled to appear again before Neiley at 9:30 a.m. July 14.Nielsen was arrested around 12:35 p.m. Sunday after he allegedly struck the jogger in the back of the head with a crowbar, an arrest affidavit states.The jogger is a Garfield County Corrections security officer who worked closely with Nielsen. Nielsen previously served 20 years for murder and was out on parole, the record states.“The staff noticed him growing an infatuation with (the victim),” the affidavit states.The female would tell investigators she was jogging in a more secluded area at Rollie Gordon Park when Nielsen allegedly struck her with the crowbar. Nielsen reportedly parked a half mile away and waited for her to appear.The jogger left her residence and didn’t see Nielsen approach her when she made her way up a trail, the record states. Once struck, the jogger turned around and identified Nielsen, who was holding the crowbar in one hand, as well as a knife in the other.“Lonnie stated, ‘I could kill you right now if I wanted to,’” the affidavit states.Once Nielsen realized what he had done, he dropped to his knees, pressed the knife to his neck and began saying he was going to end his own life, the affidavit states.“(The victim) stated Lonnie pressed the knife on his neck hard enough to make him bleed,” the affidavit states. “And she told him not to do that.”At this point, the victim noticed a person walking a dog nearby. The victim then turned away to try and conceal her injury. She also convinced Nielsen to go to his car to get water. When Nielsen agreed, she ran back to her residence and called 911 with her husband.The victim was then taken to Valley View Hospital, where she received multiple stitches, the affidavit states.Meanwhile, New Castle Patrol Officer Christopher Contreras was dispatched to the area after receiving a report of a woman covered in blood at Rollie Gordon Park.Contreras encountered Nielsen running on a nearby road, noticed Nielsen was bleeding from his neck and began asking him questions, the affidavit states.At this point, Nielsen allegedly tried running away through a nearby alleyway. Contreras eventually caught up to Nielsen, pushed him mid-stride into a fence and placed him in handcuffs while he was on the ground.“The male had shortness of breath and was sweating profusely,” the affidavit states.Nielsen was taken to Grand River Health in Rifle before being booked into custody at the Garfield County Jail. ",09.06.2022,Ray Erku,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/rifle-resident-faces-first-degree-murder-charge/

COVID-19 cases are again on the rise in Pitkin County,"['https://cdn.aspentimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/07/IMG_2014-scaled-2-1024x683.jpg', 'https://cdn.aspentimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/07/Covidupdate-atd-070822-1-1024x731.jpg']","The rate of community transmission of COVID-19 in the Aspen area is sitting in the high level, with 32 cases reported to Pitkin County Public Health in the past seven days.The , which this week is almost 200 cases per 100,000 people, is one measurement used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the community’s transmission level. The other is the COVID-19 hospital admission rates and beds occupied by people with the virus.On Thursday, Aspen Valley Hospital’s status was sitting at “comfortable.”“We have six individuals who have been hospitalized over the last 28-day period,” said Carly Senst, COVID-19 response and epidemiology program administrator for Pitkin County Public Health. “This includes individuals who have been hospitalized because of COVID and those who have been hospitalized for other reasons but are positive for COVID as well.”She noted that numbers do not reflect those currently hospitalized since they could change by the hour with new intakes or discharges.Also on Thursday the free testing site reopened at the Aspen airport cellphone lot, which is the only location where PCR tests are offered at no charge.The downtown Aspen site at the Armory Building last week transitioned from free to $120 for same-day testing.Senst said results from the PCR tests at the airport kiosk take between 36 and 48 hours to get back, and the change to the downtown location is a result of state and federal funding.The county was able to secure funding for the location at the airport through the summer, and governmental entities are in negotiations for the fall.Free Binax at-home antigen tests continue to be available at the Pitkin County and Basalt libraries while supplies last.Senst said community transmission is high as the virus continues to mutate and a lot of people gathered for the Fourth of July weekend.“Where we are now, this is the most complicated part of the pandemic,” she said, adding that people’s sense of security is likely stronger if they’ve received their two immunization shots and the two available boosters.But people should consider the risks they could bring to those who are more vulnerable due to age and health risks, Senst noted.“Risk management is key,” she said. “It’s up to each individual to mitigate their own risk.”The vaccination rate in Pitkin County is over 80% and there is evidence that boosters work, according to health officials.“We see higher antibodies in people who are boosted,” Senst said, adding that there are less severe infections at the hospital due to the high number of people who are vaccinated.According to county public health officials, there has been a common misconception that if a person gets infected with COVID-19 once, their immune system will build its own natural immunity to protect them from contracting the virus in the future.That is one reason why many individuals choose not to get a COVID-19 booster shot, even if many months have passed since they were last ill with COVID-19 symptoms. on the county’s website, there have been five reinfections reported in the past seven days and 318 since March 1, 2020, when the pandemic first began.Another round of vaccination clinics begins next week in the Roaring Fork Valley and runs through July 26.In addition, Pitkin County Public Health is hosting a virtual town hall meeting at 6 p.m. on July 13 to answer public questions about child vaccinations.Senst said it’s an open forum for parents who have questions and to have conversations with health specialists about efficacy, brands and any other concerns.“We want parents to be able to have their questions answered,” she said.",08.07.2022,Carolyn Sackariason,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/covid-19-cases-on-the-rise-in-pitkin-county/

Artist Yinka Shonibare honored at Anderson Ranch’s annual Recognition Week,"['https://cdn.aspentimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/07/Yinka-Shonibare_Photo-James-Mollinson_small-1024x770.jpeg', 'https://cdn.aspentimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/07/Shonibare_Nelsons-Ship-in-a-Bottle_2010_view-4_large-1024x769.jpeg']","For Yinka Shonibare, Anderson Ranch Arts Center’s 2022 International Artist Honoree, art is personal as well as historical. “Primarily, of course, I make work about my own history, my own background,” Shonibare said in a Zoom interview in late June. The conceptual artist was born in London, grew up in Nigeria, studied art back in London at Byam Shaw School of Hart and Goldsmiths College, where he received his master’s degree in fine art.“I have an understanding of both Africa and Europe, and also the historical relationship between Britain and Africa, … particularly between Britain and Nigeria, and so my work does kind of deal with those issues,” Shonibare said. About those issues: The artist’s work delves into “colonialism and post-colonialism within the context of globalisation,” surveys “race, class and the construction of cultural identity,” comments “on the tangled interrelationship between Africa and Europe and their respective economic and political histories,” according to a provided artist biography. Shonibare will receive the International Artist award on July 14 at a  gala, a hallmark event of Anderson Ranch’s annual Recognition Week (July 11-16) on the arts campus in Snowmass Village. Tickets range from $1,000 for a cocktail hour and $2,500 for an individual seat to $40,000 for a VIP table joined by Shonibare. (Only one of those experiences was available and has sold out.)The artist also will present a free  the day prior (July 13 at 12:30 p.m.) in conversation with Belinda Holden, who helms the Yinka Shonibare Foundation in the U.K. and Guest Artists Space Foundation in Nigeria, and Douglas Fogle, the curator-in-residence for Anderson Ranch. That event is free and open to the public in person with a virtual option; advance registration is required.Shonibare joins a roster of creative luminaries like Simone Leigh, Nick Cave and Ai Weiwei on the list of Anderson Ranch International Artist Honorees. He has been nominated for the Turner Prize and awarded the decoration of member — then, in 2019, commander — of the “Most Excellent Order of the British Empire.”The artists’ 2008 mid-career survey began at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney and toured to the Brooklyn Museum in New York and the Museum of African Art at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C. And in 2010, his first public art commission, “Nelson’s Ship in a Bottle” went on display on the Fourth Plinth in Trafalgar Square, London.His practice is interdisciplinary in medium as well as theme. “Work does evolve over time, and so I’ve gone from making paintings to video, sculpture and public sculpture, so the work has certainly expanded,” Shonibare said. The artist also uses batik textiles — “which everyone always imagines that the fabric is actually from, originally from Africa, but actually, it’s Indonesian-inspired fabric produced by the Dutch and then sold in West Africa,” Shonibare said. “I find those relationships kind of fascinating,” he added. “So I’ve developed … a number of works using that historical relationship as a starting point.”Shonibare finds the present of that relationship compelling too: “There’s the obvious kind of colonial relationship, which by any means wasn’t equal (then), and also the legacy of that in today’s in a multicultural Britain,” he said. There are themes, too, that connect to the United States, like “the history of African Americans in America,” Shonibare said. Viewers may bring their own experiences and interpretations to his works as well. “I give people the information, but I don’t think there’s one way of reading a work of art or engaging with a work of art,” Shonibare said. “I think people take from a work what they want to take from it.”In addition to the big-ticket Recognition Dinner and free Summer Series talk with Shonibare, Recognition Week programming will feature a slate of art-making and art appreciation offerings open to the public. On Monday, a “Critical Dialog” program featuring curator Anna Katz and artists Marilyn Minter and John M. Valadez will explore “What’s So Real About Photo Realism?” The workshop runs from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and includes lectures and discussion; registration is $500. Mini art-making workshops will be offered Tuesday morning and afternoon and Wednesday morning, with sessions that explore mediums like ceramics, printmaking, photography, woodworking and painting. Space is limited but waitlists are available; each session costs $150. An online auction is now live, with bidding open through July 14 at 7 p.m. during the Gala Dinner auction. The online auction features works by artists like Oscar Murillo, Derrick Adams, Maya Lin; many of the pieces are on display on the Anderson Ranch campus in the Patton-Malott Gallery through July 14. Eager bidders can also participate in an auction on July 16 at the Ranch’s annual Art Auction and Community Picnic, which runs from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. The event usually takes place the first week of August but this year is scheduled at the conclusion of Recognition Week; this will be the first picnic since the summer of 2019 following a two-year COVID-19 pandemic hiatus. Registration is free and required for the picnic and auction. Participants can choose to purchase a $15 wristband for all-you-can-eat food and $5 drink tickets for beer, wine and sangria; free popcorn, cotton candy and snow cones will be available to all. For more information on all Anderson Ranch Recognition Week programming, visit . ",09.07.2022,Kaya Williams,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/artist-yinka-shonibare-honored-at-anderson-ranchs-annual-recognition-week/
